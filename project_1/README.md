# Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis
## Introduction 
The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)
* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

It is noted that each state has a Board of Education that monitors studentsâ€™ academic performance. In some states, the students are required to participate in the ACT or SAT standardized test. ([*source*](https://testive.com/state-sat-act/))

## Problem Statement
This project aims to explore trends in SAT and ACT participation in the United States for the years 2017-2019 and seeks to identify factors that lead to an increase in SAT participation rate. 

## Summary of Findings

**1. There is an inverse relationship between state's ACT participation and SAT participation**   
- This is likely due to the fact that students taking one standardized test will not take the other.  
- ACT and SAT are similar in content but not identical, which means students have to spend additional effort to achieve mastery for both tests.  
- Either of the standardized tests is accepted by Ivy league universities, hence there is little motivation to take both tests. 
    
**2. There is an inverse relationship between state's standardized test participation and the state's mean score**  
- States with a high participation rate are likely due to compulsory participation due to state education policies. AS such, there will be a larger number of students who are less prepared to take the tests which then lowered the average score. 
- On the other end of the spectrum, states with a very low participation rate have students who are well prepared and willing to take the test on their own accord. 

**3. There is a decreasing trend of ACT participation rate and an increasing trend for SAT participation rate**  

**4. Several states with significant changes ACT & SAT participation from 2017 to 2019**  
- States sudden surge in the SAT is due to the compulsory testing requirement set by the state's education board. e.g. Colorado, Illinois


### Recommendations

To increase SAT participation rate, we can consider making SAT mandatory for high school graduation. Based on the data that was explored earlier, states with changes in testing policies had the largest change in SAT participation.

Secondly, we can consider subsidizing SAT so that students are allowed to participate at no additional cost.
