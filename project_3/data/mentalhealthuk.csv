MentalHealthUK,01/11/22 19:36:48,Rejected Petition Advise,"Hi, I posted on here a few days ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ry41q6/please\_help\_my\_petition\_receive\_the\_5\_signatures/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ry41q6/please_help_my_petition_receive_the_5_signatures/)) about my petition 'Make mental health problems an authorised absence in all education institutions'. 

Unfortunately, the petition got rejected and I received this response: ""It’s not clear what the petition is asking the UK Government or Parliament to do. There are already provisions in place for absences if a child cannot go to school because of illness or injury, and this would include issues related to mental health. Monitoring student absences is the responsibility of individual schools. If what you want is for children to have a right to take time off school on days of their choosing, we could accept a petition requesting this, but it would need to be clear exactly what rights you wanted the Government to give students"".

I was wondering if I should follow their suggestion of a new petition where students can choose their day-offs from schools and how to be clear on what I want the government to do. Or if I should start a new petition on a different website asking for the government to create a UK version of House Bill 2191 in Oregon ([https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2191](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2191)). This bill grants students the right to take mental health days off from school and was campaigned by a group of teenagers ([https://www.ted.com/talks/hailey\_hardcastle\_why\_students\_should\_have\_mental\_health\_days](https://www.ted.com/talks/hailey_hardcastle_why_students_should_have_mental_health_days)). 

I am up to suggestions and feedback because while some schools may accept mental health as an authorised absence by classifying this as an illness, I'm not sure all schools would do so or what my next step should be. Thank you for reading :)"

MentalHealthUK,01/11/22 08:18:24,Severe OCD thoughts about simulated reality," 

What should I do? I have OCD but I can't get over this intrusive thought about living in a simulation I don't 100% believe this thought but I keep thinking that if an advanced civilisation had the ability to make simulations then they most likely wouldn't because of ethics, but if the person that made this was a bad person then how do I know that if I'm a good person then I'll be tortured for being good. A bad person wouldn't want to reward a good person, but also does that mean being a bad person will make me not be tortured? How do I get over this thought I need someone to counter my argument because this is ruining my life. I've told my therapist and they said it's just down to my overthinking. I go to CBT and it isn't really helping I need a therapist that can go through the problem with me rather than just telling me that I'm overthinking and trying to teach coping mechanisms."
MentalHealthUK,01/11/22 07:53:49,Finally got in touch to get some help but have some concerns,"Not had the best month, finally decided enough is enough and got in touch with my GP about getting some help. In terms of what i think i have, i think it's Anxiety, OCD and C-PTSD. They told me on the phone i will get to talk to a mental health nurse in a few days time.

I have kept most of my problems bottled up my entire life, and never sought help(I'm 27) whilst i am proud of my self for finally wanting to deal with it i have no idea what this talk is going to be like.

Can they prescribe me and SSRI's? can they give me a diagnosis? after the talk will it take me an age to actually see a psychiatrist/psychologist to get things sorted(on the NHS).

I'm also worried that that by getting treatment, it will get me to acknowledge some things that happened to me when i was a kid and may change the relationship i have with some family members which are mostly solid relationships right now or atleast i think.

I guess i'm just scared, it feels like i've set the ball rolling on something i don't think i understand, any help will be much appreciated in terms of addressing my worries, in particular what i can expect from this consultation with the mental health nurse, thank you."

MentalHealthUK,01/11/22 01:08:19,Advice for CMHT assessment?,"I have a phone appointment with the CMHT tomorrow, this is an assessment to see if I am ill enough to see a psychiatrist. I am suicidal on a daily basis and haven't responded to half a dozen or more meds, but only after major poking would the CMHT offer me this assessment, even after an overdose (now 3 months ago due to communication errors). I just want access to medication that GPs/others are not authorized to prescribe, this means I need to speak to a psych and there is no other option.

I am very scared that they will either defer me after the call, or keep me as their patient but only to be monitored by nurses long-term. All I want is to access meds - I already have diagnoses of GAD and depression (treatment resistant). But even if I do gain access to meds there is not much else to try; NHS will no doubt be too scared to attempt an MAOI, and I've already tried meds like Pregabalin (scheduled drug, as far as it goes here) which did absolutely nothing. 

Sorry for the long rambling message. Is there anything I can say in my call that will ensure that I can speak to a psych? I can't go any further with GPs so I will probably just suicide if they deny me ( not that I will tell them this)

thanks"

MentalHealthUK,01/10/22 22:04:55,How can I fix my mental health?,"Hi Everyone

I'm not one to usually post my problems on reddit but I seriously need some help because the UK mental health services is so bad.

I found out when I was 18 I probably have adhd and I've been to the initial diagnosis and the guy told me it's not if I have it it's how bad. But 5 years later I still haven't got diagnosed mainly because of covid and I keep getting told 'I'm top of the list when they take new patients on but it's not quick enough and I can slowly feel myself falling apart.

I've suffered from bad anxiety and depression since my teens and a lot must've stemmed from my untreated adhd as I always acted different. I've tried SSRI's a few times but the initial weeks make me more depressed and because of feeling suicidal I'm scared to let myself get that bad. I've just stopped telling my doctor how I am anymore because it never gets me anywhere 

I've done my own research and taken supplements like Gingko, 5htp, Gaba and Phenibut but all of them have little to no effect anymore and I just need something to help me get back to myself again.

I smoke cannabis quite heavily as it's always been a crutch for me but I know this isn't doing me any favours I just don't know how to stop because my social circle is built around this since I was an early teen. 

I want to bring some structure into my life and persue my goals because my mental health has seriously held me back for too many years. If anyone could give me some advice on how they overcome their similar struggles it'd be much appreciated! Thanks"
MentalHealthUK,01/10/22 20:26:23,I've just started fluoxetine - what are you experiences on SSRIs?,"Hey, 

Just started fluoxetine last week. Been a while coming, had some initially good results with CBT/mindfulness, but recently been strugling more so spoke to GP and started SSRIs.

Only been a week so far, not really noticed anything yet - which I completely expect... Other than yawning my head off all weekend that is, which I guess may be a side effect!

What are your experiences with starting SSRIs? How long did you take to notice an effect? Good effect, bad effect, side effects etc?"
MentalHealthUK,01/10/22 15:41:30,A month of dumb decisions and bad anxiety,"Just a bit of a vent of what's going on.  


Backstory - I have been dealing with anxiety for a good number of years, and prior. However it has really intensified as I went to uni and now that I have my job. I lived alone during uni and have been though several anxiety meds. I am also autistic.   


Anyway, I thought I was doing much better mid 2021 and stopped my anti depressant meds. I was struggling a bit during the following months but it wasn't too too bad. However it got worse every single month that passed.  


Fast forward to last month, I felt awful. I thought that everything around me was making it worse. I now lived with my mother and brother and everything they did irritated me. I had no space. Out of frustration I booked a bunch of apartments. I was convinced moving out was going to help me. I lived alone before, this should be fine right? I found a place and moved over Christmas.  


Long story short it didn't, it just made everything 10 times worse. It's been 3 weeks of hell. I needed to sort out bills, payments, as well as manage my health, my cooking, throwing out the trash, everything under the sun when living alone. I could not sleep properly or eat more than half a piece of fruit for the last 3 weeks. It did not help my mental health and I am even paying more and feeling worse.  


I did sign a 1 year contract, but luckily I called the landlord and they were happy to help me end it early. I am very happy because I really did not think it was possible. I should get more details today. I will have to pay marketing fees so they can put up the flat for rent again &amp; rent until they find a new tenant, but I will take that over this. I will have to call everything and cancel it all, and then move aaall of my stuff back, but that's fine.  


And I am going to call my GP to get anxiety medication as soon as my GP opens in 20min. I should get them sometime this or next week hopefully.  


It has been an expensive mistake but I have learnt to never do something so big out of frustration.  And hopefully the rest of 2022 will be much much more chill than this."
MentalHealthUK,01/10/22 14:46:23,What to say to GP/ what has been your experience,"Basically in short have not been honest in the past about suicidal thoughts/self harm and drug use/abuse because I was underage probably because I didn’t want anyone to know and didn’t want it on record. I am now 20 and going back to the gp next week not sure what to say. Have been diagnosed with depression and took a few counselling sessions but was not honest there either, I am now at a low point and really want to sort my life out.

So yeah basically what do I say to gp, that I lied? Do I ask if it’s possible for a physician to diagnose me? Do I mention drug use or will that become the centre of the conversation? What has been your experiences 
Thank you"

at 17 i was prescribed fluoxetine (prozac). i stopped taking it after 3 months due to it “not working” anymore. i have had to wait since then for a diagnosis before i can be prescribed anything due to being under 18. due to the back log i only got seen to by CAHMS in december and they said there much they can do since im basically 18. what will my GP be able to prescribe me when im 18( in one month)?

one year wait for cahms lol"
MentalHealthUK,01/10/22 09:14:58,It's just becoming unbearable.,"I was diagnosed with bi polar about 10 years ago and later on an emotionally unstable personality disorder. I'm still unmedicated as in the past I had pretty serious life threatening side effects, which put me off meds and I decided I would try and manage my symptoms with exercise. 
It seems to work ok to manage the depression and keep the psychotic symptoms away, but over the last few months I've started to go on such a relentless high that at times I haven't been able to focus on simple things and found myself just endless doing exercise to try and calm down, watching TV, scrolling Reddit and eBay to try and escape the relentless anxiety and stress, with little to no success. 

I've become so desperate recently I reached out to mental health services again, self refering myself to health in mind, I also called an NHS mental health help line on Nov 12 at about 3am because I was rushing around the streets trying to get fresh air and calm down. The nurse on the phone told me call my GP in the morning and ask for an urgent referral to see a psychiatrist and get my lack of medication situation sorted. 

That was almost a month ago and I still haven't heard from a psychiatrist. I had a strange call from a pharmacist asking me what meditation I would like to take? I said i guess a mood stabilizer, and asked what he would recommend, he asked about my symptoms and when I explained what I've been through over the years he said he didn't feel qualified to prescribe me the right meds and thought it best to refer me on to a psychiatrist. I wonder why I wasn't referred to see a psych in the first place? Seems like such a waste of time when I was told I needed an urgent referral to see a psych. 

It's totally bizarre, so does an urgent referral to see a psychiatrist really take almost a month? Is this because of covid and mental health services are so overwhelmed? 
It is driving me insane, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do to get the help I need?"
MentalHealthUK,01/10/22 07:32:20,TW: self harm. I need some advice or reassurance,"Hi there,


About three days ago I self harmed (cut) for the first time in four years. It was very impulsive and I'm mortified. I thought this was all in the past (and it is!) but I can't shake this shame I feel that I've failed myself. I suffer from anxiety and depression and I'm highly emotional. 


I'm not sure what I should do - should I phone a GP? I'm already on max dose duloxetine and have tried many of the other meds over years and this suits best but I'm still struggling. So I don't know if talking to the GP is worth it as they always just refer to med changes? I have a primary MH person but they don't tend to get back in touch very well, which means I've had to phone the crisis team about 3 times in a week and they are 50/50 on helpfulness (one the other day told me just to get a good night sleep...) 

So yeah. Not sure if I'm just venting or asking for some advice, on what steps I can take? I knew my MH has been bad for a while but I'm shocked at my own behaviour because I put years of work in to stop SH."

MentalHealthUK,01/10/22 06:14:23,I accidentally hurt my baby and now I’m losing everything,"Hello,

I have just joined this subreddit as I’m going through a traumatic time right now and have been dealing with anxiety and depression for over a year now. 

A bit of background info before I get to the nitty gritty stuff…

I have a daughter (8 years) from another relationship and a son (10 weeks) to my current partner. 
My partner lost a child to stilbirth around 7 years ago from a previous relationship. 
Before I got 50/50 contact for my daughter, it was every other weekend. It took an awful long time but we ended up there amicably in the end and even my partner gets along well with my ex and she even stays for cuppas and such!
I am also mid-way through treatment with a counsellor over the phone tackling my anxiety - which I feel had been improving. 
In the last 6 months, I’d been developing low tolerance and a bit of a temper - of which I informed the doctor and he increased the dosage of my meds. 
I want to clarify before I start, that I have never hit a woman or man in my life and never harmed a child in any way whatsoever prior to this incident that I’m about to detail. 
Before my depression, I used to be confident, sociable, kid-at-heart and fun to be around.
I am an over-thinker and always beat myself up about the smallest of things. 

I’m not sure where to start exactly and I may rant, so I will do my best to include everything I can, but I hope you can take the time to read and let me know your thoughts on the situation. 

On Christmas Eve 2021, I decided to stop taking my meds (30mg Mirtazapine) as I take them just after tea time around 6pm. I wanted to have a few drinks over Christmas and New Year, stay up a bit and enjoy time with my family. Everything seemed to be going well until New Years Day. 

I like to point out that I stopped smoking weed around 3-4 weeks ago and I stopped smoking cigs/tobacco on New Year’s Day. 

My son has been having a difficult time in his short little life thus far. He had to be induced at 37 weeks and was in ICU for a week due to water in his lungs. He’s also had to have specialised formula (non-cows milk) as he was in so much pain with regular formula and breast milk. 

On New Year’s Day in the evening, my partner was going to go upstairs and settle him to sleep but I told her that I would go upstairs and ease him. 
I was upstairs for around 1-2 hours trying to feed him, rub his belly, sing him to sleep, rocking him…anything I tried just didn’t seem to work. I broke down crying asking him to please settle and at one point I tried to forcibly keep his dummy in to no avail. Shortly after, my partner decided to intervene and take him off me to give it a try herself. 

I was an emotional wreck and I snapped at her and argued. I came downstairs to calm myself down. An hour later, my partner came down and said it looked like he has bruising on his chin so I said “what’s that from?” And she responded with “I don’t know”. And left it at that. 
I was being incredibly stubborn and was in a mood with her even though she did absolutely nothing wrong (this is uncharacteristic of me). I also developed a cold and was worried it could have been COVID so I decided to sleep on the couch for a few days and she stayed upstairs with my son. 

She would keep checking in, making sure that I was okay. Handing me lemsip and offering me food. Still ill and stubborn mind you. On the 3rd, she was hoping I was feeling better so that she could bring our son down to me for cuddles. 

Four days had passed (so we’re talking January 4th) and my mum was going to pick up my son for the night after she finished work and my partner knew this. When my mum arrived, we waited and waited and my partner wouldn’t answer our calls. Around 6pm, I finally got a call from her phone and it was a social worker informing me that she was at hospital with my partner and our son as he has a bruise on his chin/lower cheek. 

With that, I broke down crying, fell to the floor and told my mum what had happened whilst I was trying to process what had just been told to me. It wasn’t long before I came to the conclusion that it was my fault and could recall what it was I had done. 

I immediately started taking my medication again. 

I messaged my partner straight away explaining what had happened and what I knew. Baring in mind, I hadn’t seen my son for 4 days. 

The next day, the social worker was round to find out what I knew. I told her everything. I’m always honest and open about every aspect of my life. 
My partner (whom was still at the hospital) and I had agreed to voluntary custody with the social workers and my mum as interim foster cater. 
They informed me that it is likely their manager would want them to take our son away from both of us temporarily with limited supervised contact but I pleaded with the social worker not to take our son away from his mother as it was my fault, but due to the fact she left it 4 days, it’s cause for concern. 

Prior to this, although my partner couldn’t believe I did it, which I genuinely did not realise I did until the social worker first rang, she exclaimed that she didn’t want to be a single mother, that she still wanted us to be together and how she wanted me to get help for mental health. 
With that, I was straight round ringing the doctors whom I also explained the situation to and begged for his help. And with that he prescribed me propranolol. 

The next day, another social worker visited and told us that that is indeed the case that we will need to pass our son to my mum but we ultimately will have parental rights. So we filled out forms and hired solicitors as it was going to court so that social services can put forward this scenario to the judge and we hired solicitors. This was Thursday 6th. They also informed me that they will be investigating with my daughter and her mother - although I have no worries there as even my daughters mother thinks I am a good Dad and has no concerns about me. I also told both my daughter and her mum everything that had happened. The hardest person to tell what I had done was my daughter but she was so understanding bless her little heart. Brings me to tears every time even as I write this. 
Social worker has informed them that I am not allowed contact with my daughter whilst they investigate them.

It’s safe to say that at this point, my partner wouldn’t speak to me - even though prior to the Thursday, we were still talking. She eventually contacted me via text message on the evening of Friday 7th Jan however this time, and with good understanding, seemed different to how she was speaking to me prior. 

To cut that bit short, I told her how guilty I am, how sorry I am, how much of a monster I am and that nobody should ever put anybody through that situation ever. That I don’t want to lose our complete family because of a stupid mistake in which I let my mental health get the better of me. 

My partner has been staying at a friends house since she and our son came out of hospital and she is allowed an hour and a half visits with him under the supervision of my mum and dad at their house. 
I however, am allowed the same time but under the supervision of social workers. 

This has yet to go to court which could potentially be tomorrow (Monday 10th) so that the social services can put forward their plan of action. 

Last night (Saturday 8th) I struggled with the loneliness and was getting overwhelmed by my thoughts, worries and guilt that I called our local crisis team who informed me that I can’t get specialist help from a psychiatrist or psychologist until I finish the course of counselling that’s due to finish next month. I can’t wait that long but I am due an appointment on Tuesday 11th Jan.

My partner visited me this afternoon (Sunday 9th) to collect a few bits of clothing and to talk. 
It was lovely to see her even though the feeling may not be mutual. She suggested that if she got the opportunity to have our son back, would I be willing to move back into my mums place. I said yes as I am willing to do anything to get our son back to her first and foremost but I asked her if it would be permanently (baring in mind we both know this interim care is for potentially 26 weeks but could be sooner, could be longer) and she said she think I would need to move out permanently. 

Many tears were to be had between us both but we also talked about other things like we used to - general conversation to a degree. She was getting picked up at a certain time and I told her I wish she didn’t have to go so soon and she said “I don’t want to go”. 
She is convinced she is never going to have our son back again and said it’s the same pain she felt as when she lost her daughter, which absolutely breaks my heart. 
All things considering, I tried to explain to her that because she is allowed contact with him without social worker supervision, that that is a positive sign and for all we know, the judge might just say to let our son go back to his mother - I don’t know, I’m not quite sure how this all works. 

Anyway, I can’t bare the thought of co-habiting another child, losing my best friend (we did everything together) and our family home. We had marriage on the cards. We have argued about 4 times the whole time we have been together (5 years this May) and she has been my guiding light and rock throughout the past year of my depression. 

I have never had suicidal thoughts nor do I ever think I will because I’m too scared of death itself. But I am struggling internally to deal with all the pain I have caused everyone and myself. My heart aches and I want to wake up from this hellish nightmare. 

I have nobody right now to comfort me. I cannot see my mum or dad because my son is there. My daughter isn’t allowed contact with me for the time being and my partner doesn’t want to see me properly right now. 
I know this is all my own doing but I never intentionally meant to hurt him. I didn’t know I did until the social worker called. And I didn’t click on to it when my partner mentioned about his chin a couple hours after the incident - because I didn’t even think or realise it at the time. 

I am just hoping tomorrow may bring some good news in light of all of this. 
I miss both my children and my partner. 

If you managed to stick through all of this I applaud you. I trust that it’s not an easy read but I thank you for your time, it’s very much appreciated. 

If there is anything else that I have missed, I will add in the comments but right now, I can’t think of anything."

I feel helpless and don’t know what to do. I feel like something’s wrong with me and it wont go away."
MentalHealthUK,01/09/22 16:44:55,MAJOR TW. Vent. My partner is s*ic*dal. I’m terrified.,"My partner had an open chat with me last night about how bad his mental health is.  I mean, I already knew it was bad, but he hid some stuff from me and he came out clean.  I was so, so hurt, but not because he hid certain things from me, but because it was so painful to hear that the one I love the most is suffering so much to such an extent.  I cried myself to sleep and I woke up feeling like I want to cry again.

I honestly don’t feel like he betrayed me by not telling me.  I just feel scared that one day he might un-alive out of the blue.  He actually came close to do it on our holiday, which shocked me to my core.  I appreciate his honesty nonetheless.

I know he is beyond any help.  He tried psychologists, meds, but he honestly reached a dead end.   He told me he’s just trying to survive now and wants to build something with me.  I now understand better his coping mechanisms, and I feel bad for sometimes thinking he’s just lazy and glued to his video games…but he doesn’t want to be here anymore.  He told me he would love to grow old with me, but he can’t guarantee that.  He told me when he wakes up, he feels like crying.  When he goes to bed, he just re-lives all his trauma.  He is not a man that lives in the present.  His traumatic past haunts him. 

I don’t care how much of a burden this might seem, but I want to be next to this man for as long as possible.  I can’t save him, and I can’t just erase this black cloud over him, but I want to know how I can help him even better."

A family member has been prescribed Mirtazapine 15mg once a day at night. They have been told to take it at 8.30pm and not drive afterwards. Does anyone with a similar routine ever take their anti depressant later than this, so they can drive later in the evening if they have an event etc or anything similar?

MentalHealthUK,01/09/22 00:17:40,How many more sessions of psychology should I give it before I say something?,"Hello everyone,

Since November 2021, I have been getting psychology. I know it's still early days, but I'm just not sure it's going to work. Let me explain why: I'm 22-years old and have been under mental health services since I was 8 or 9-years old. Many people in the health service have considered me to be complex, my GP and the mental health team have told me directly that I'm complex. I have OCD, autism, depression and lots of anxiety issues. I worry about everything and anything. I also have social anxiety. I've been in and out of the mental health services since I was about 13-years old. I was under CAMHS a long time. 

When I was turning 18, my psychologist wrote to the adult mental health team and said as to why I need to be under my local CMHT. I was seen and within a few months I was discharged. I then got thrown from pillar to post. One place, back to my GP, back to Access and Assessment team, and then back to my local CMHT.

Ever since August 2018, I have been under my local CMHT. They have been so bad and left me in the dark for so long. They never checked up on me and left me alone to get on with it for so long. 

Fast forward to now, I am finally getting psychology sessions. However, in every session, I cry, I don't feel that engaged because I feel like it just won't work for various reasons. It's only been the 5th session, but I still feel so hopeless and upset that they've left me for so long. I also think they don't take me seriously because I'm morbidly obese. I think they're blaming all my problems on my obesity. I'm not 100% sure though. 

What do I do? I feel like complete rubbish every time I come out of the session. I cry at every session and feel like an utter failure. I always feel like calling up the crisis team, or the duty team at my local CMHT. I feel like I'm beyond repair. I just want to live a life that's full of joy, but my thinking patterns and beliefs are so messed up that I can't stop thinking. I also am constantly thinking about my mental health (which isn't good for me)."
MentalHealthUK,01/09/22 00:03:21,"Seeing the home treatment team tomorrow, looking for advice [TW: Mentions of death, suicide attempts and substance misuse]","So I'm going to see the Home treatment team tomorrow at hospital, after a hellish week that would even scare Satan. I'm not purposely trying to dismiss what I've gone through this week but I've had enough of crying.

The long &amp; short of week is that my MH has been worsening (this started around Christmas) + a friend of mine passed away this week rather suddenly - He was only in his 30's because of all this and generally feeling inadequate I felt lost, alone and unsure what to do so I attempted suicide on two consecutive days. 

I went to A&amp;E last night after thinking I may attempt again. I didn't but they did refer me to Home treatment. I've been under MH services for around 13 yrs and never been seen by the home treatment team, how do they differ from the regular CMHT?

I know HTT come to your house but what else can/do they do? 

This week has sent my behaviour spiralling &amp; I'm acting extremely erratically and more impulsive than usual so any advice/support on how the HTT help is much appreciated.

Thank you x

As a kid your supposed to enjoy life as a teenager your supposed to enjoy your young years and your 20s are supposed to be fun and full of things but here I am at 29 living the same life every day no friends no life no relationship no carrer not knowing anything about life or about who I am or who I want to be, so stuck in such a deep hole I've lost any sense of who I am or who I could be I feel like I missed out on all the fun of teenage years hoping my 20s would be fun and free but I've spent my 20s pretty much alone no sense of a future hoping I don't miss out on more life but as I fast travel towards 30 I don't see it getting better and I don't know how to improve or change my situations and circumstances and all I see is that I too shall miss out on my 30s 40s and so on until the load is too heavy to bear and I end it what's the point in carrying on if you don't see something in the bleak dark to walk toward. I have no idea how to even start making any significant change and I know the cliché advice of workout or join things find a hobby but I've done this and I'm doing it but it hasn't really made any significant change I just have new ways to waste time unfilled, it's also hard to find things to try because I'm so uninterested in anything and everything nothing calls me or gets me excited I do things just to do them. I feel like my 3 situations are hopeless or limited 1.social 2.hobbies/interests 3.work

How do I get some sort of enthusiasm to live some hope that things can actually be okay that I might one day find friends find a place in the complete emptiness of life, feel like people care about me see me know that I'm alive where I'm at right now nobody even knows if I'm a alive or dead because I have no place on anybodys life"

Yet, these prescriptions don't seem to touch my anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure). The little research that I have done suggests that suitable treatments could include ketamine and MAOIs but I have been consistently disappointed by NHS provision and maintain low expectations. I would be interested in whether others have had experiences relating to anhedonia and its treatment in the UK, particularly where successful or involving ketamine or MAOIs.

But recently due to my mental health I’ve been ending up just lying in bed not really doing much and I’ve just been thinking, like I don’t even know if I’m happy or sad anymore.

Like one moment I could really down and almost close to tears and then the next moment I could be laughing with friends. But even after laughing I come back to the motionless state where I don’t really feel much.

MentalHealthUK,01/08/22 05:58:30,How do I talk to my GP about feeling depressed,"I had major surgery in November that was recommend for me and I signed consent forms, understood the risks and actually wanted it done at the time. The closer to the surgery the more anxious I was feeling and wondering if I really should go through with it. I was feeling this way even walking to the anastetic room and laying on the table I was still not sure, I could feel my heart rate was getting high and I was in the beginning of a panic attack, then it was too late. The drugs worked and I passed out.

Obviously I woke up and remembered having a dream but do not know what it was, this didn't bother me at the time but is really worrying me now. Did I wake up ? The surgeon won't tell me anything and just wants rid of me, understandable. He wouldn't tell me about a pain in my foot either or what could have caused it, the surgery was nowhere near it.

I had a region block that lasted for 6 hours post surgery and was paralyzed from the waist down thankfully. When it wore off it did quite quickly, going from uncomfortable to excruciating and the worse pain I had ever experienced. Cue a panic attack that I cannot remember until I calmed down after they started the Morphene PCA and put me on oxygen. The next 12 hours I was half in / out of sleep walking when the pain turned and pressed the button again etc. 

In the morning the surgeon woke me suddenly and I was not sure what was going on, he then pulled off the compression bandage. It really hurt so I pressed the button , it had fun out. Obviously in tears at this point in a lot of pain. The surgeon just said, it looks ok, I will get a nurse to finish removing it. I didn't know that the hell I was supposed to do and think I blacked out for a bit before i pushed the call button.

Need to compress the next parts, can't think anymore. They wouldn't give me any effective pain relief during the next 5 days and I was in agony. I told them constantly that I was in pain but nobody would listen to me. I contemplated jumping out of the window that night but it didn't open far enough and it was only the second floor. I struggled through the next day, don't think I stopped crying. They stopped asking my pain score and just kept writing 0 in the form and when I found out the next night I hit the roof at 3 am. Screamed at the nurse to write on the form that I was in serious fuc&amp;1ng pain and they had not asked me if I was in any. They called the on call GP that sedated me with sleeping pills.

It's 7 weeks later and I still feel like crap. I have considered overdosing on pain killers but can't bring myself to do it. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. What am I supposed to do ? I just don't want to feel crap any more. I wish I hadn't had it done. I'm still in pain and any time I think about it it sets me off crying or feeling angry and I can't stop thinking about it. Everything makes me think about it. 

And before anyone recommends exercise I can't walk for more than five minutes due to the pain. I hate talking to people and it's hard enough feeling guilty about not being happy. Being guilt tripped by one of the nurses in hospital didn't help either. Can't write any more, I'm in an absolute mess."
MentalHealthUK,01/08/22 05:05:56,unsure of how to move forward,"
for a long time now, i’ve been feeling completely worthless. like everyone around me has someone and i have absolutely nobody, like everyone is out to get me and secretly hates me. i have friends, i just don’t feel that they like me at all and that i’m not good enough for them, even though they probably don’t feel like this towards me.

i feel very sad and uncomfortable a lot of the time, wanting to cry for no reason and doing so for hours. i want to be able to go outside everyday and have fun, especially because i’m still young, but i don’t have it in me. i’m so so tired and every day it just gets harder and harder for me to get out of bed, tidy my room or even shower. 

i often find myself getting very angry over small things, especially towards the ones i love most. i don’t want to hurt them, but every time something they do aggravates me even slightly, i find myself snapping almost immediately and yelling, often leading to crying for a long time afterwards in self pity, which i am extremely ashamed of.

eating is also becoming a huge problem for me. i always feel like not eating when i wake up, so i don’t, and then i’ll go hours without eating. i don’t really feel the desire to eat at all at the moment, but i manage small things, even if they don’t provide me with sufficient energy.

all of these things have become an individual hurdle in my daily life. i want to be able to stop, but i’m unsure of how to help myself. i’ve tried multiple mental health services, yet nothing has made a difference.

what am i supposed to do? is it self improvement that i should work on? is there something wrong with me? i’ve been left unanswered for so long, i just want it to stop."
MentalHealthUK,01/08/22 04:19:01,Worried about using Sentraline 50mg,"(19yr Male)
I was prescribed Sentraline 50mg by my doctor for chest pains and heart palpitations from anxiety. I read up about the side effects and now I'm really scared to use it. I've been having chest pains and heart palpitations for a few months this all started when I had an energy drink ,which I usually don't drink, and had a ""caffeine rush"" (idk what it's called) which increased my heart rate and I had heart palpitations. I was really scared when it was happening but once the caffeine rush was over I started experiencing chest pains and heart palpitations mainly because I was worrying about my health because of the chest pains etc. Once the doctor explained what was happening I was relieved and the chest pains and heart palpitations weren't as bad and happened less even now it doesn't happen as much and I can sleep easier. It still happens occasionally but not as bad as before. It only happens when I'm at home if I'm outside I don't experience anything.

I have 4 questions
1. (If youve used it) what was sentraline 50mg like for you (what was your experience)
2. Is there any other way to stop these chest pains/anxiety ect. for example : exercise.
3. Can I stop using it after a week or two if bad side effects appear
4. Is it possible to have no side effects

I hope this makes sense.

I don't want to take sentraline 50mg because of the side effects I read about but if I have to I will.

The 1.5 years were pretty rough and I've switched between many different meds. I'm now on Vortioxetine and feeling much better. I've also had CBT once via NHS and councelling once. The CBT helped me a bit with anxiety, the councelling just made it worse in the long run tbh.
I was desperate to have more therapy so applied in September for some that costs less (I work a minimum wage job), now they contacted me to say they'd have a spot.
Do I still take it or not? I feel at the moment I don't need therapy but also know it's something that may help in the longrun, but I don't wanna take up someone else's space when I wouldn't even know what to talk about.

TLDR: Have struggled with mental health for a long time. Could have therapy again now, unsure I want/need it. Do I go for it?"
MentalHealthUK,01/07/22 22:31:48,I'm not sure I can see a way out anymore,"24 year old with ADHD, depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. Last few months have been the worse as I pretty much became an alcoholic and poly drug addict. Taking anything from xanax to ketamine, coke and diet pills along with my adhd medication. 


I ended up having to go off work a month ago after a deliberate overdose attempt. And I'm lucky that I get full sick pay, but once you have 12 months off sick in a 4 year period, it drops to zero pay. But my job (royal mail), has caused my mental health issues to be 10x worse. And I'm not the only one at my work place. 


Obviously I want to go back to work, I'm seriously missing the overtime that I always do, but I'm still an absolute mess. I'm currently tapering off alcohol and xanax/valium and it's fucking horrible every day. And my body dysmorphia has kept me inside my house for 3 weeks now. I've literally not tasted fresh air for 3 weeks. 


I'm finally at rock bottom and have no idea what to do anymore. If I don't somehow sort my problems out quickly, no doubt I'll end up losing my house (mortgage). And I can't ask for my parents for help as my mum is currently dying with cancer. So right now all I can think is to just end it. I see no way out anymore."

MentalHealthUK,01/06/22 22:29:58,Having difficult conversations with anxiety.,"Hi All,

Just thought I’d get a bit of perspective/advice on here. I suffer with anxiety and depression and as such can be extremely sensitive to conflict etc. My partner has recently asked me to marry them, to which I’ve happily said yes. My parents don’t like my partner (not for personal reasons - we are a same sex couple and they don’t approve of that, plus add to that my partner used to date the child of a friend of theirs many years ago). 

I need to tell my parents about this. But I expect the reaction to be poor and I’m having panic attacks/being sick at the thought. Does anyone have any tips about how to deal with hard conversations like this when you have anxiety?"

I won't go into detail, but it's phobia related and has become completely unmanageable in the last year or so. 

I've never been formally diagnosed and haven't had any treatment for mental health issues since high school so it won't show up on my medial records, but if I'm being totally honest I think I've had phobia symptoms for about as long as I can remember.

I've been planning to tell my insurance provider that my symptoms started a year ago (which is sort of true; that's when they got much worse) but if I do end up in therapy then I'd probably need to be honest about the extend of the problem.

How much detail do health insurance providers get about what's said during therapy sessions? Will they find out that my symptoms started much earlier than I've told them?"

Anyways today I spoke to my dad and he said that I'm not doing and am waiting to get kicked out of uni basically. He doesn't understand why I can't just do the work or why I'm not being more proactive in arranging help. Is he right? Do I need a reality check?

MentalHealthUK,01/06/22 19:56:01,Any advice?,"Need help or advice…

Right I’ve been finding it hard quite for a while now. 

I little background info, I’m 20 years old from near Liverpool and currently studying a design subject in London. I’ve suffered from anxiety for a good two years now (though it wasn’t diagnosed) and now since October I’ve really down and depressed. At first I thought it was because I wasn’t used to face 2 face learning as I hadn’t done it in a while or because I was now balancing a part time job with uni since I wasn’t getting enough money to live off from student finance. 

I just wasn’t sure why I was feeling the way I was. I had lost complete motivation and for almost a week I didn’t get out of bed, not to eat, not to drink and not even to procrastinate (which I may add I’m amazing at). But it wasn’t just procrastination that was the cause I generally felt like shit. I couldn’t really tell too many people as my family had shit going on especially with my mums health and we don’t really speak about that stuff in my friendship group. 

So I turned to some online help using a text msg service with people who give advice but that always seemed unhelpful and was never something I took on board, it just helped cause I felt like I had someone to tell.

Since then I had a deadline, which due to my mental health getting worse and I getting some meds to hopefully help the situation luckily I got the deadline pushed back from the 20th of December to the 12th of January which was amazing but now it’s the 5th of jan and I’m still working on my projects and it’s going not bad ish. And i haven’t been too unmotivated yet…

But I got back from home today and it’s safe to say I may know why I was feeling so bad, I just miss being home when I’m not there. Like don’t get me wrong I love being home when I’m there but after a while and I know people can back me up on this, it can be sometimes be abit too much and sometimes I just wanna leave. But since yesterday and even worse today I just wanna be back home I’m feeling like shit again and not really wanting to do much. And quite frankly have started to hate uni I guess because of it, idk maybe not. But I have plan of what I wanna do, but it just seems too far away to be like yeah I’ll stick at it for another few years.

Sorry for the long story and you all might feel like its abit if shit thing to be depressed about but it’s been going on for far too long. Maybe some of you have some advice how to stop feeling like this.

Idek if that’s the reason why I was always depressed but it seems to be the reason right now, but it’s new to me because last year I didn’t feel this bad at all, regarding depression."

So I'm currently getting weekly psychology sessions with a trainee psychologist. It's only been 3-sessions and I know I've still got to give things time, but I spoke with this man at my mental health team today and he said something like ""there's only so much we can teach you. If we teach you the sills and if that doesn't work there's no where else to go after that."" This actually scared me because I know there are other services out there. They surely can't just let me suffer and go on how I am if this psychology doesn't work? I do have a mental health advocate (thankfully!) that specialises in autism. She's going to try and get me the right help I deserve. 

However, I am now worrying and thinking about what that man said about how there's no more help after a secondary mental health service. Is this actually true?

I am now trying to see if I can get a private assessment, just wondering if anyone has any recommendations in Scotland? 
Unfortunately we don't get Right to Choose like England"
MentalHealthUK,01/04/22 23:39:15,Just had my last meeting with the crisis team! it went well,"I feel really good and I was like completely honest with him and they seemed happy to discharge me.  


The whole week I had been really really bad. I really thought I was going to end up back in hospital but then on new years eve I didn't sleep at all and suddenly I felt really good. I had the best day I'd had in **months**. Saturday night I did sleep and had a bad day on Sunday as a consequence, sunday night I didn't sleep and yesterday was pretty good. Then today I have slept and I feel good?! It's so weird it was like a switch flipped. I have so much energy today I want to go for a run (I have never gone for a run in my life). I want to shout the lyrics to my music really loud.  


I'm still only eating one small meal a day but I feel good about it and the MH worker didn't seem too worried. Also I've been picking my skin more (although I'm too embarassed to tell anyone about my picking). He made a comment about me looking better (happier) I think because I had a shower this morning and I was smiling a lot more (although I did also cry a bit but the smiling outweighed that).  
We also got a bit sidetracked talking about my mum. I realised that me and her are very similar. She gets in these moods where she feels really unhappy, she can't explain why but she thinks that everything is bad/ going wrong, also she's pretty anxious and she thinks she looks fat even though she's a normal weight too. She's not been to a doctor about it though.  


The plan now is that I will go to the SUN group which is a support group for ppl with personality disorders and those kinds of challenges. I'm feeling better about that too. I had been feeling like they wouldn't want me there because I'm not diagnosed with a personality disorder and also feeling like i was in too much of a crisis to attend but now I feel really good.  


I think i'm going to go for a walk now :)"
MentalHealthUK,01/04/22 20:45:27,What are the policies that therapists follow for emergency contacts?,"Hi I hope this is the right place to post this, I live in England and do weekly private counselling (no with the NHS) when I started with my therapist she asked for a emergency contact. I want to know in what situations will she use the emergency contact? I am over 18 so I have confidentiality on my side. But I wanted to know when would she use the emergency contact? Thank you"
MentalHealthUK,01/04/22 18:15:43,I need to vent before I do something dangerous TW/CW,"I have been waiting bloody ages to actually get an appointment with the mental health team in my area and it finally took a suicide attempt on Boxing Day for them to actually get in touch.  

I was supposed to have an appointment at 9.30am today with someone from the MHICS team at a local GP surgery. I even received a reminder text from them yesterday. I turned up early today, waited around for a bit because I was as nervous as fuck &amp; I desperately need this appointment. Only to be told. There is no appointments of that nature booked there at all today.

The crisis team have been out to me at the weekend and I have been honest with them about my suicidal feelings &amp; they just said that the MHICS team will help with that. It feels like I may not even get as far as seeing them!"

MentalHealthUK,01/04/22 08:17:01,Would I be able to get any financial help at all?,"I've been dealing with hallucinations, delusions and paranoia for 3 months besides occasional events in the past where it's happened, and I've suffered with anxiety, and social anxiety for years. I've not been diagnosed with anything yet *(I am very very sorry if I am wrong in calling these hallucinations, delusions and anxiety they are all just what I've been told by my friends and others I've contacted in times of crisis)*, and I've got a 2nd information collection session in February, after being sent in essentially a circle, being referred to one place and referred back to where I was before.

My family, particularly my dad, is upset that I've left university (I did so because of the hallucinations and anxiety, I was convinced that I was going to be assaulted and murdered if I stayed there any longer, and couldn't speak at all), and haven't got a job. They acknowledge that I'm dealing with serious issues, but we're not very well off in the first place, so they want me to claim benefits. I of course don't know how to, and from my point of view it's impossible (I've tried the PIP self-test and it says I don't qualify), and my parents don't have the time to help me.

I more often than not struggle to leave the house because of my hallucinations, I struggle to talk to strangers out in public, and I will get extremely anxious and paranoid if I'm on my own for too long. I struggle to make food for myself, because I get worried that I will injure myself or cause a fire, since I don't actually know how to use a cooker, or any recipes of food that I can actually eat without being sick. I can use a microwave, however. I am worried that if I go much longer without a job, my parents will kick me out and make me homeless, since there is no reason for them to house me in the first place. I want to get medication, or therapy, stop having these episodes of hallucinations, and go back to university, but unfortunately I'm now an adult, and I don't think life is that forgiving.

Could anyone please offer some advice as to what I should do from here in terms of getting financial help? The more I make my parents wait, the angrier they will be with me, but I can't help the waiting times. I feel pathetic, and embarassed that I am actually asking for this, maybe because of how villified certain members of my family have been, but my mental health is very very bad, and I don't think I'm well enough to hold a job, and I can't exactly go back to university right now, since I would need to go through applying all over again."
MentalHealthUK,01/04/22 07:37:09,Help/Resources for 'Young Person' in Scotland,"I'm in Canada myself, but I've recently had a 'young person' (16) in Scotland confide on me over instances over what I believe to be neglect and emotional abuse. Long story short, she has autism, recently lost a pet, and has been struggling to cope. She's latched on to me, because I've been trying to help her correct the parameters of her tank for her other pet, which has been hard because of the natural climate there.

In the 3 days that I've been helping her, she has been yelled at, called paranoid, had her feelings belittled on several occasions, abandoned (her mother left for the day, leaving her do deal with the loss and trying to correct the tank on her own), and the mother has been threatened to call the police ('disturbing the peace', apparently) and NHS24, claiming she's 'crazy', all while in the midst of a panic attack, just for trying to take the steps to correct her pet's husbandry.

I'm at a loss of what to do for her. I don't have any way to get to her, and through a number of bad experiences, she doesn't trust the authorities, or the people who are supposed to be there for her.

Any advice would be appreciated."
MentalHealthUK,01/04/22 02:42:41,Cuddle therapy?,"Has anyone had experience with cuddle therapy? 

I found out about it last year and booked an appointment with someone via www.cuddlecomfort.com for the 23rd of December. During the run up to it Covid started to rear it's ugly head again and I cancelled it in response. Since then my housemate has been naysaying it hard and I'm having doubts. Since my marriage broke down I've been alone and longing for physical contact. Talking about it on Reddit and people have suggested I might be contact starved. Cuddle therapy makes sense, at least to me.

What are your thoughts? Have you tried it? What was your experience?"
MentalHealthUK,01/03/22 22:48:15,Private facilities in Scotland,"If I can't get my mania under control soon I'm most likely going to need inpatient so my parents can go back to work and me to uni. If I need that I'm looking to go private as I can't face NHS. Relatives in London use priory and there is one in Glasgow but I've never heard anything about it so just wondering if anyone knows good facilities/ facilities to avoid in Scotland for a short stay to get fluctuating mania under control. Don't have a diagnosis yet. Either bipolar, cyclothymic, schizoaffective or borderline but I'm skirting the boundaries of everything so need people who can deal with any of those."

With the permission of the moderators, I am posting this request.

My name is Susie Bennett, and I am a researcher at the University of Glasgow. Through my work, I try to understand male suicide risk and recovery factors better.

**I am looking for men who have attempted suicide to take part in my next study to co-design a research agenda for investigating male suicide.** 

At the moment we have lots of research areas to investigate in terms of their link to male suicide - domestic violence, sexual abuse, food, relationships, body image, loneliness, work, sexuality, parental alienation, and many, many more. I would like you to help me decide which questions are most important. Together we will produce the first research agenda for male suicide. We will develop the key questions for researchers to tackle to improve our understanding of male suicide risk and recovery factors.

If you are a man who has previously attempted suicide and would like to be involved, you can read further details of the study and sign up to take part here: [https://suicideresearch.co.uk/research-agenda/](https://suicideresearch.co.uk/research-agenda/) and if you have any questions please get in touch with me and I would be very happy to talk more.

Many thanks for your time and thanks to the mods for letting me post here.

Take care,

MentalHealthUK,01/03/22 15:19:02,I can’t sleep,"The past couple of days I can’t get to sleep it’s like my mind is going insane with just thoughts. Like I have been trying to sleep now for 4 hours and can’t because I keep thinking in a bunch of voices but they’re all mine saying different things and I keep imagining a man with a deformed face, stretched and fucked up limbs is haunting me whenever I close my eyes and I sometimes hear breathing and sounds like knuckles cracking underneath my bed. I’ve had to turn my nightlight or whatever you call it on because I’m terrified. My mood is going fucking mental aswell coz I’ll go from being happy to feeling like I wanna cry then to angry for no fucking reason. This has been going on for about 7-8 days now. 

Should I speak to my mum abt this or someone else?"
MentalHealthUK,01/03/22 04:44:06,Medical reapplication of driving licence?,"Hi, my drivers licence got revoked after I came out of hospital. I reapplied and they gave me a year version. It expired and I’m reapplying again. Do I have to get a new licence every year now? Is there a system in place to stop reapplying constantly?"
MentalHealthUK,01/03/22 03:51:30,Slipping back into depression," 

I'm 18 nearly 19 years old. Things have changed dramatically, and for the better, since this time last year. I'm no longer suicidal. I have confidence. I stopped hating myself and started not necessarily loving, but liking myself.

But I feel that's starting to change, and not for the better.

I cried in the small hours of this morning in bed for the first time in a long time. I feel alone. I have a friend but thats it. Progress on last year. The other day some people I thought were friendly-ish, well one of them was disgusting to me after I made an innocent enough joke like he'd make at me, but he didn't like it. No loss ther I didn't like him anyway but the stuff he said...the way i look, dress, even the fact im in a crappy job rn.

I've tried hard to get a relationship, but as usual, it's proving hard. Dating apps are my only way really right now as i dont really have a proper job. Some girls literally unadd me after they see a picture of me. Not that I'm even ""ugly"". I had to drop out of university at the start of the year (where i actually lost my virginity on my first night) because I got pneumonia. I found out the other day that there are false rumours going around which are very vindictive and damaging. Meaning I probably can't go back there.

I don't think a partner should ever be your source of happiness, but I can't help but feel it is a big thing when I'm seeing everyone else with theirs. I'm autistic and sometimes think maybe thats why but most people wouldn't know. I will find out relatively soon if I'm successful in the job I'm applying for, a job that will basically set me up for life and be a lifetime career but it could go either way. Ironically enough the biggest hurdle will probably be the fact I'm on meds. If I fail, I don't know what I will do. Six month wait to reapply. I worked in retail earlier this year. For a week. I hated it, i was treated like shit and I'm not working somewhere like there again. I'm going to reapply for different universities but I'm not sure if its for me. But then other than the job I am applying for I have no idea what to do.

I'm fed up of being alone. I'm a hard man. I don't take shit from anyone anymore. I've had the shit bullied out of me year after year, I've stood on a bridge with my life on one side and death on the otehr, I got back up every single fucking time, no one will land a punch on me that I can't get back up from. I'm a fucking warrior, a survivor, so I get upset when I cry. I feel even though I've changed myself, the world around me, my life, hasn't really changed.

And that really bothers me. Because I was expecting some things around me to change in response to me, and whilst I have been more successful with women than the yhear before, I'm still very much single and have been for well over a year and a half, and its so demoralising. The fact I'm also don't even know what job I want.

If someone can please offer advice. I don't want a counsellor. I've seen so many - counsellors, physchiatrists, psychologists, hypnotherapists - all as useless as each other, to me anyway. I've always relied on myself and will continue to do so. I'm not afraid to admit I might need help on the way, but ultimately I think I've got to do this by mself. This is my life, even though plenty of people have been resonsible for fucking it up."
MentalHealthUK,01/02/22 23:26:07,Have you used text based therapy?,"I feel like I'm too reserved and closed off for face to face therapy, but I've been on sertraline for a year now and I'm still just meh, although a lot better than before. 

I was thinking of a text based therapy option such as Better Help or something. I would feel much more comfortable opening up in this format. 

Any experiences to share? Any other info is useful too."
MentalHealthUK,01/02/22 22:01:28,What did I just experience?,"Hi. I have a history of DPDR and related issues. I experienced something weird the other day on NYE. And I don’t understand why or what happened. I wasn’t on drugs at all and I don’t know how this happened. 

I was going to try kMS on NYE. I bought things to do it. I did attempt but I’m okay now. But this is the weird thing before and during all this. I was heavily depersonalised but felt real. Everything around me was breathing and alive. Things didn’t look flat or distant and unreal. They were vibrant and dancing with me. Life was with me and I was with life. It was like being on drugs without being on drugs. I felt like I was a part of life. 

The air was touching me like it cared and the bushes around me had this weird care about them. Everything looked more beautiful than normal. I was walking like I was alive. I didn’t walk all rigid and afraid with a pit in my back. I walked loosely and freely. I sat on this bench in the town centre for 2 hours dissociating and just experiencing this feeling of ease, bliss and peace. I don’t want to sound crazy or psychotic about this. The trees cared and I cared about them back, everything was alive and cared. I was on their level. I became this passive open shell experiencing something. I wasn’t separate from life anymore. I was just there. 

Probably the best experience of my life so far, actually feeling so grounded and real. Today I’m resting after it all. I’m currently in the bath trying to look after myself. I still feel passive, no strong feelings and have no identity. I don’t feel as good and want my identity back, I am super depersonalised and can’t do anything but rest. Which is annoying. But why? Why did that happen and what was it? I didn’t take any drugs. I just don’t want this possibly meaning more psychiatric issues. Is this mindfulness? But then why so depersonalised?"
MentalHealthUK,01/02/22 21:54:12,Advice for Psychosis?,"I’ve only ever really suffered from paranoia and delusions, when I’m in a depressed state my symptoms are worse, but recently I’ve been becoming fixated on certain delusions, they follow me every day and now it’s turning into other symptoms, I felt like a demon spoke to me through my television screen a few days ago and I’m convinced some of my friends are part of a cult that are after me. The mental health services have always dismissed my psychosis symptoms because they only presented in the form of delusions but I feel as though it’s progressed to something more serious due to lack of treatment but I don’t know how to go about asking for help, I live in the UK for reference.

I'm not sure how I'm supposed to know if I can drive or not? Obviously there are people out there on stronger doses of AD than this who are happily driving about. At the moment I feel fuzzy headed and wobbly, so I wouldn't feel confident getting behind the wheel, but do I wait for this to go away?

The GP told me that I couldn’t be prescribed any antidepressants because i was too young as I was 18 at the time. The call ended with the GP telling me to look into counselling and call him back in 2 weeks. I looked into it and decided it’s not for me but I never got round to calling him back. I’m now 19 and in the exact same position as before if not worse and I don’t know what to do. Should I call my GP again?"
MentalHealthUK,01/02/22 07:53:29,Private doctor for meds?,"I’m from the US, so I’m used to a very different, more efficient (though more expensive) mental health system. I have dealt with anxiety and depression since grade school, so Im no novice (currently 30s). GPs here seem to have no time to discuss my concerns or just don’t care. In the US I had a private psychologist who I went to once a month to discuss my medication, dosage, whether it was effective, etc. Is there something like that in England? I’m not looking for a therapist, I know how to find those. 

I moved to this country during the pandemic and things have taken a toll on me. I’m really spiraling and the system isn’t working. And yes, I’ve dealt with IAPT, who only offer CBT which isn’t what I need."

I had been on 160mg once a day of propranolol for the last 7 years and it worked well, but i wasn't happy with how foggy it made my brain feel and the few times i would run out/forget to take my meds, the adverse effect would make me feel very ill. So my doctors have given me 40mg up to 4 times a day of propranolol instead and i'm trying to only take it when i need it, but i think my body isn't used to it yet.  


In the 3 days since i switched meds, i've had a panic attack, argued with my partner, had a massive depressive episode staring into the bathroom mirror just insulting myself and considered quitting my job. i know this anxiety is all in my head, but it's just a bit overwhelming after a negative time of year.

I miss family and good times; my anxiety is really high and I’m spiralling into depression. Maybe I’ll bounce back when I return to work next week but right now I feel so low.

MentalHealthUK,01/02/22 01:30:38,The NHS is putting me under extreme danger,"I suffer with my mental health and an eating disorder (ARFID). I desperately want to gain weight but can barely manage 600 calories per day.

My weight is critical right now 100lbs at 6ft. I’m worried I’m going to die and feel extremely bad (unable to get out of bed other than to go to the toilet).

I’ve been to A&amp;E three times this past week and they just keep sending me home.

Rang the crisis team countless times and get nowhere because I have community appointments coming up which will be useless.

I’m at high risk of refeeding syndrome and sudden death yet they send me home?!!

It’s to the point now where I think I’m going to end my life as I can’t take anymore of this. 

Seems like I have no options but to starve to death horribly or cut it short by doing it myself.

There’s no private hospitals in my area and I wouldn’t cope traveling 100+ miles in this condition."
MentalHealthUK,01/01/22 22:26:15,Relief after grief - not sure where to post,"So we lost our dog just before Christmas. She was coming up to 10 and by far my best friend in the whole world - she saw us through moving out, renovating, getting engaged, starting a family together.

We expected her to live longer than she did, as did the vets - both times we had her examined recently they told us she was in perfect health and just having a few age related mini strokes, however we asked for blood tests and it turned out her liver was failing. She lasted less than week after being diagnosed, we did everything we could for her but she declined rapidly and we had to say goodbye. The whole thing was pretty traumatic, by far the most upset I've ever been in my life. I know we made the right decision, I just wish we had longer together.

It's been a few weeks now and the thing I'm struggling with is our life has chilled out quite a lot since she left and I feel guilty for enjoying it. Our other dogs are a joy to walk (she was an absolute disaster, she would howl all the way through and she hated other dogs), we don't need to keep the other dogs quiet in the evening in case they wake our son up (she would hit the roof if I went out and opened the door to come back), she would boss the other dogs around and wouldn't let them play together and she was incredibly needy towards us. Now she's gone we're just left with these two well behaved chilled out pets, the dynamic is different and although I'd have her back in a heartbeat it's just so much easier to manage now than it was.

Tldr; dog died, feel guilty for enjoying life with our other 2 better behaved dogs."

I'm looking for idea on what people would like to hear discussed about mental health?

I've been vlogging for about 2 weeks now as a way of raising awareness and hopefully helping people.

I've already done about 70 videos of how mental and physical health have impacted my life growing up and really want to cover subjects we struggle with.

I'm also doing my opinion and thoughts on usual day to day things as I feel my mental health has affected my ability to think. I think sharing how my brain works can be used to teach people the struggles we have even doing the basics.

Please let me know what you think 

Thank you very much.

MentalHealthUK,01/01/22 12:08:18,Paranoid delusions.,"Hi all. Just looking for help and advice. For the past year or so I've been trying to help someone close to me suffering with delusions. The delusions include things like being poisoned, phones are tapped, partner is against them, people hiding in the loft, people stealing the water supply. 
I've been pushed from pillar to post with the NHS to a point where the person tried to kill themselves (granted the dose was low but the intention was there) by overdosing, to which the hospital just discharged them without any worry. The problem I've got is my hands are tied because as Ive been told by all the professionals I can't do anything unless the individual seeks help themselves, issue is they believe everything is true therefore the issue isn't with themselves. Its literally brought their surrounding relationships with family and partner to there knees.
Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time."
MentalHealthUK,01/01/22 11:32:54,Medication for under 18s for social anxiety disorder,"I’m 17 and on the waiting list for therapy with my local IAPT for my social anxiety. I want to have therapy but the waiting list is very long- the website says an average of 12 weeks- and it’s only been 3 weeks since my assessment and I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this for so I’d like to try medication if there is any way I can. I know that for depression antidepressants are only allowed in under 18s when therapy hasn’t worked and supervised by a child psychiatrist, does anyone know if the rules are the same for anxiety disorders? Since I’m not with CAMHS and it would probably be pointless for me to be referred there since I’ll be 18 this year so would probably struggle to see a child psychiatrist, would there be any point in me going to my GP and asking for medication or would that be pointless?"

I've suffered from anxiety and depression pretty much my entire life, and have tried just about everything before turning to medication. Basically there are two options left, medication and suicide, to be quite frank.

So my GP got back to me after I waited 4 weeks, and over the phone prescribed me Sertraline 50mg. After some anxiety-spiking confusion I finally got the tablets from the pharmacy yesterday. The GP recommended I wait until the new year to start taking them. But now I'm frantic, because I can't even remember the GP's name (i'm new to this area and recently registered with this doctor's surgery) - and if it took 4 weeks to get an appointment last time, what if something goes wrong? Side effects etc? 

I'm particularly scared because apparently you're not allowed to stop taking them cold turkey, but at the same time, if I can't get a follow up appointment before the prescription runs out, what do I do?

Sorry this is a bit of a jumbled rant. I should be downstairs with my family on NYE but I'm on about 30 browser tabs trying to work out what to do."
MentalHealthUK,01/01/22 04:54:05,Do you have moments of overwhelming sadness?,"As of late, these have been more and more frequent for me. The sadness that really feels like a weight, I will stay in bed browsing nothing for hours, or curl up and just cry. It's so hard because I also feel like it's my own little pity party and I deserve to feel like this for however long. This sometimes switches to anger at anything; people I know for being happier than me, university lecturers for what I see as them failing me, GPs for being utterly useless at helping me.

I'm sitting with my family right now with one of these moments thinking about how much I want to not exist. I have nothing I enjoy or get excited about anymore."
MentalHealthUK,01/01/22 04:05:32,Question about suicidal intent and capacity,"If someone wanted to die, and they just completely gave up the pretense of being happy with staying alive, just said flat out ‘I don’t want any more treatment, I don’t want to get better anymore, I just want to die now’, would they be considered to not have the capacity to make that decision? 

From what I understand, a lack of capacity means a person does not understand the consequences of their decision or cant understand the situation enough to make a decision in that moment e.g someone who is severely mentally ill (schizophrenia, bipolar etc.). But if this person is not severely mentally ill and this is the clearest they have been thinking in months, if they understand the situation fully and still want to take their own life, can ‘lack of capacity’ be used to force them into treatment even though they have clearly thought it through? Or will they still have the option to refuse treatment?"
MentalHealthUK,01/01/22 03:40:42,Go fund me advice,"Hi everyone I hope you're having a good day.

I've been very busy with my kids and loving every minute with them.

I'm looking for advice please.

I've set up a go fund me. I'm feeling really guilty as it's for an amplifier which is to help me through my counselling as I rely on music.

I'm not going to be harassing people for donations etc but wondering if anyone has had any success with go fund me?

I've never asked for anything in my life so super uncomfortable about it.

Thanks in advance"

MentalHealthUK,12/31/21 13:23:28,Feeling like giving up,Apparently I am a stupid person I hate having autism no one understands or wants to talk maybe I should be with my mom its been a year and 4 months since she passed it hurts my feelings people don't understand or offer to talk.  No one wants to talk to me on voicecall I give up. I hate myself.  Bye. Can anyone please talk on voicecall if they have it please.  I have discord and Facebook and Instagram and snapchat and wattsapp.
MentalHealthUK,12/31/21 12:20:29,Is mental health support awful nationwide or just me?,"Background; 24 year old who's talked openly about mental health since I was a lil boy. I was in CAHMS, without any progress, then moved onto adulthood and still the same.


I've been prescribed SSRIs before but they just make me dull, numb and I can't have sex on them. I've had 4 suicide attempts (overdose) since being an adult and yet again, no support. I was turned away from my local eating disorder team because I was drinking and taking drugs, to try and suppress the eating disorder. Catch 22? 


Fast forward a couple of years and here I am. Several overdoses and hospital visits this year, yet no support. I'd just get discharged and left on my own. My entire body is covered in scars from cigarette burns, yet I can't seem to find any help. 


The last time I called my local crisis team, I had the police called round to handcuff me, throw me in the back of a police van and sectioned until I was released. 

So yeah, I don't know what advice I'm looking for here, I don't expect to be alive for much longer. But why the fuck is our mental health services so dire in this country?"
MentalHealthUK,12/31/21 11:03:27,"Having a wobble, not sure where to turn now","Hi peeps, I’ve been battling for the past few years though have been going very downhill this past month or so. 

I was under 18 when things were really bad last time, but am now 22, so not sure what my options out there are given I’m now an adult. 

Ideally I don’t want to be sectioned or do anything that jeopardises my career, but think it’s time I ask for some serious help. 

Just wondering what others have found most useful and what might be best to do quickly? 

Thank you, you lovely people :)"
MentalHealthUK,12/31/21 07:34:18,Do I have any alternatives to my waiting time?,"I had a bit of an episode in September, I was hallucinating quite frequently, possibly delusional and definitely paranoid. I won't detail them, but these hallucinations kept occurring and seemingly getting worse until around mid-late December when they mostly stopped. I talked to the GP about them in mid October, and got a referral to a central mental health thing, which referred me to an anxiety counselling place. They were quite alarmed and referred me to the central mental health thing again, saying that they don't think they have the resources for what I'm dealing with. That's going to be in February. I have been waiting since the start of December, and I am struggling a lot, I have been staying at home keeping to myself because I don't want my hallucinations to affect my family. Do I have any chance of being seen sooner, since I'm worried about having another serious episode. I really want to survive this, being now slightly more aware of how serious hallucinations are, but I don't want to be put in a psych ward under any circumstances."
MentalHealthUK,12/31/21 00:58:50,Feel like a zombie,"In the last few weeks (roughly coinciding with my Mirtazapine dosage being increased from 15mg to 30mg), I've had many days where I haven't been able to function properly. Everything seems like one of those scenes in films, where a character is stationary in the middle of the screen, and everything is just happening around them at high speed. That's the best way I can describe it. I feel like my head is stuffed with cotton wool, and I'm kind of just there.

Has anyone else experienced this on Mirtazipine, or can offer some advice how to deal with it, as it's ruining my life. I can't enjoy anything when I'm like this, and it's happening more frequently."
MentalHealthUK,12/31/21 00:50:59,Just need someone to talk to or have friendly discussion,"I got on really well with taking them but when i was on amisolpride my legs would stop walking whilst i was out in the middle of nowhere it was horrible i could run but couldnt walk slowly wouldnt allow me to like my knees would bend like jelly and i had to pull myself along on garden walls. and certraline did nothing. Then i was on aririprazol which i stayed on because it helped a lot but the othe anti depressants citalopram and ecitalopram kept making me flush sweat in the night i would wake up freezing in a cold wet bed, soaking wet. Then after that i gave up on mitrazapine they just didnt change anything in my brain for the better and i could see myself getting on stronger tablets which i dont want to take no matter what. Aririprazole tho am i right 😂 

If youve seen my other thread it goes into more details about what got me on the tablets but and that im also wanting just to be supportive of other. idk what i even want to talk about but I'll lend an ear aswell I'm not expecting a lot just a congratulations for getting off the pills in despite whats happened."

Thanks :)"
MentalHealthUK,12/30/21 14:51:33,I did it.,"Long before but also after a 3/15 GCS severe head injury (which i had no support with until i was diagnosed with pychosis) i have still proved i have the will to live. After battling anxiety, psychosis, depression, ADD, OCD, i have realised how amazing I can make my world. Please if you think you need it really need it just do it whatever it is you have to charge through it and dont be scared about ""hurting"" strangers or else youll bottle it and hurt the people you love the most. Do it whilst you still have the chance i will always be here thinking of you. You'll soon find out and you'll pick up a lot on the way. Its never too late and nothing is impossible."
MentalHealthUK,12/30/21 07:11:30,I've been doing some research. I've been playing down my mental health for too long.,"Ok so I suffered from depression for 10+ years. I was suicidal and made repreated attempts on my life. My circumstances changed though, and I was able to recover from the depression. Anxiety came as part of the package though, and I just thought that being terrified of any kind of social interaction was just a part of having 'anxiety', but I've been doing a lot of research in the past few days and I reckon I'm suffering from at least a couple of personality disorders. 

The symptoms of Avoidant Personality Disorder are like reading an article about myself. I honestly consider myself sub-human, and I avoid all social interactions where I can because the mere thought of having to be a socially accepted person fills me with dread so I'd rather avoid it. So I have. For many many years. Because of that, I have developed a severe drink problem too. I need to get my endorphins somehow, right?

I just feel it would finally answer so many questions if I could get officially diagnosed but I have no idea how to go about it. Do I just go to my GP and tell them exactly how I've been feeling and what I think it is? Or self-refer myself to some kind of mental health unit?"
MentalHealthUK,12/30/21 06:54:42,My day today,"Hey everyone I hope you're all doing well.

I've had a crazy busy day much to my dislike as I had to go to a wedding. I don't cope with everything to do with weddings.

Big groups of people I know is bad enough let alone strangers, drunk loud people, paranoia of being watched, that fake happy feeling you feel from everyone and the over discomfort you sense from everyone.

It's been an absolute stress filled day for me and no way of getting any comfort at all. I had to drive which I haven't done in years. I can never cope driving to new places and today I had to suck it up and do it as I couldn't exactly refuse being the only person who doesn't drink.

First of all comes the horrible discomfort of wearing a suit then realising I don't have dress shoes only to find a pair that have no grip. I have a clot in my right leg so feeling is bad in my foot so if my foot slips I don't realise until I'm pretty much lying on the floor (I actually fell down a whole flight of stairs at hospital once because of it). Instantly I've paranoid if I don't wear these dangerous shoes I'll be the talk of the wedding for wearing smart but casual shoes with a suit.

I decided I couldn't afford to fall and damage myself so I was sticking with my comfort shoes but I did look stupid.

Then the weather is horrendous and can hardly see whilst driving and cars all around driving like it's a sunny day so my nerves completely shot.

Then there's loads of emergency vehicles zooming passed with their lights flashing. Unfortunately since my chemo my migraines have amped up 10 fold and as a result blue lights can actually bring on a migraine attack which includes vision impairment so that is always a massive worry.

Sat nav took us to the wrong place so again my anxiety was screaming at me and having my wife and her dad all trying to give me directions when neither knew where we were just completely added to it all.

Just as we are about to finally pull up to the venue my wife's aunty phones asking if we can go to a shop. Without thinking my wife just agrees so now I have to workout in my brain through a a battle of anxiety how I do this in a town I've never even heard of let alone been to.

Anyway I suck it up and eventually find a shop and the. Manage to get us back. No idea how. I get lost on roads I've driving on 100's of times so I have no confidence at all.

Then comes the anxiety of walking into a strange place full of strange people. That silence when you walk in and everyone is stares to see who you are. Wahhhhh I'm screaming in my head. Head down find a corner and stand.

People who know my wife and her dad come over to chat. People I've met many times and I still have no idea who they are so have to pretend I know them so not to hurt their feelings.

Then the hypervigilance takes over to an extreme ott level and whilst my wife and her dad are chatting away happily I'm looking at everything, taking every single detail in, hearing every single bit of noise but as my wife talks to me I can't focus on her words because I have everything else screaming in my head.

My wife is talking about one of her aunt's and how pretty she looks and all I can see are men fidgeting with their collar's, trousers and kicking their feet due to the discomfort. Women pulling at their dresses and tops because they're comfortable with what their wearing especially with how much skin they're showing as they keep holding their tops in or up whenever they move.

I stand there wondering why do we all do this to ourselves? Why do we put so much pressure on us to look a certain way and be a certain way just because we feel we have to fit in?

I see young girls of about 10 wearing stuff I used to see women wearing when coming into the club I used to work on the doors at when I was much younger and I'm wondering why can't kids be kids. Let them have their fun rather encouraging them to be kids and have a carefree happy childhood.

I then start questioning who I think I am for even judging people when I'm questioning why people are pressuring themselves to do all this?

Then the real fear. I've got to sit and pretend I actually want to be here through the ceremony whilst in my head I just want to be at home away from all of this.

The ceremony feels like a lifetime but in actual fact wasn't even an hour. I'm trying to look focussed on what's being said and done whilst trying to watch for signs I need to laugh but timing is everything. I don't want to know too late I've to laugh because then I'd be the only one laughing and if I get it wrong I've no idea what I'm laughing at.

Phew I got through the ceremony with no major mistakes.

Then we get taken to the dining area. Oh jeez I forgot about having to eat. I start sweating as I'm paranoid people watch me eat when out as I eat strangely. I eat each thing on the plate individually. Never mix my good. Possibly the autism?

I look at the menu. Ahhh lentil soup, I can have that easy enough. Main course steak in a red wine sauce, I can't chew it as I haven't got my false teeth. Chicken in a peppercorn sauce, I don't like pepper.

I can't eat anything for the main so now in sitting at a table with 12 people and the only one not going to eat a main.

The food arrives and the waiting staff keep on asking me what I'm having for my main. I'm starting to get really annoyed now as it's most definitely obvious to the whole venue I'm not eating so I stand up and go for a smoke to hide whilst it's all being dished up.

I come back and see kids have macaroni cheese, damn I could have asked for that then at least I'd not be standing out.

The woman next to my wife has chicken with no sauce, damn I could have had that then at least I'd be eating an adult meal but instead I'm eating nothing.

Then the desert. A plate of trio or something which instantly annoys me. What is on the plate? Can I eat it or do I like it. Why not just give us an option for desert? If nothing else it would reduce waste.

Thankfully I could eat all the deserts except ice cream as I don't like it.

I'm angry though as each pudding is a mouthful so 3 bites and it's all gone and I look around and there's loads of waste as people leave what they don't like.

It's all too much and my migraine is getting worse so once again I reach for my embarrassing shoulder bag (sports one whilst wearing a suit) to sneakily take out my oramorph and a syringe so I can go to the toilet incase anyone sees me.

The younger girls at the table (10ish) don't miss a thing and see me putting a bottle in my pocket along with a syringe and I see them reaching over to their parents. Great I've been spotted now everyone knows what I'm doing or should say making up what I'm doing. I mean what could be in a bottle that needs a syringe will be what they're thinking.

Dishes are all picked up. Great that means not long till the first dance then we can go. Nope 2hrs sitting not even able to hold a conversation but my wife's dad is talking constantly and I have no idea about what. He's showing me pictures of things on his phone and I've no idea what they are.

Everyone is now screaming as the drink is well and truly taking over and all I can feel is all the nerves in my brain being ripped apart with every scream of laughter.

It's now approaching 7pm. We left our house at 9am and it's getting close to the last ferry so we're going to miss the first dance. Damn we could have left 3hrs ago.

Now the panic of driving in the dark. All it takes is one person to have their full beam on then I have to stop for an hour for my vision to come back.

I'm focussing much harder to make sure I see everything on the strange roads I've never seen before. Head is absolutely screaming at me in pain as my migraine is determined to let me know it's here.

Ahhhh back to the ferry in time and a massive sigh of relief as I know I'll be home soon.

Once we get in the babysitter asks how it was and both me and my wife say it was lovely. Was it? No it was absolutely horrific and will take me a couple of weeks to recover from and why? Just because we put pressure on ourselves to do things a certain way and be a certain way because it's expected.

Sorry for the long text. I don't usually write like this and as you can see I'm not very good at it lol.

I hope you all had a good day. I'm just taking my hundreds of bedtime meds and I'm going to crash. By hundreds I only mean about 20 lol but it feels like hundreds."

MentalHealthUK,12/29/21 23:47:04,Does loss when young cause issues as an adult?,"Is there anyway I can find out why I'm so unaffectionate and my confidence is so bad? I (40 F)  have been diagnosed for a long time with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. I've experienced a lot of loss from a young age.
Mum died from cancer when I was 11
Brother (who I was really close too) died when I was 18 in an accident
Lost my friend to alcohol (she was in her 20s)
Stepmum died from a lung disease when I was 23
Basically I'm trying to figure out why I'm so unaffectionate. I never cuddle my husband off my own back (been together for 20odd yrs) he always has to ask.
I have a great relationship with my dad although he's quite ill himself. We've not a touchy feeley family but I have had plenty of love. 
The family network is very small due to loss and people moving etc 
I feel like a harbinger of doom. Everyone seems to leave me, is this why I'm like this? I can't take a compliment my confidence never seems to improve. I'm always the same miserable person"

MentalHealthUK,12/28/21 22:16:04,Mental health is getting too much,"I've been dealing with a few mental health conditions for a number of years now, been on different medications and awaiting therapy through the NHS but I'm finding things too much at the moment 

My mental health went down till pretty much 2 years ago. I started getting really depressed, not feeling ""myself anymore"". I made some very big mistakes/choices in the last 2 years that haven't helped where I am today 

In the last 2 years I walked away from a long term relationship due to being convinced I wasn't happy and thinking my mental health was getting bad because of the relationship but it was more my own problem. After leaving, I ended up moving a total of 9 times, entered a new relationship which was abusive for just over 7 months. Between May 2020 - September 2020, I attempted taking an overdose 4 times due to not coping with my mental health, my living situation and just feeling so overwhelmed. I ended up blocking out/losing my memory on a lot of things that happened since January 2020

After my last overdose, it was pretty serious and I ended up in a 4 day coma. Since then I've had an ongoing sickness condition, where I'll spend days being sick non stop then I'll be okay again. I've had a lot of investigations, food intolerance tests, scans, blood tests, x-rays but they cant find anything medically wrong with me. They are putting it down to my mental health atm, that when I had my breakdown, it caused stomach problems for me 

I miss so much work due to these problems, I'm on a written Warning for my sickness. I don't get paid for sickness, so it adds to my money problems. My landlord, I'm currently renting a room in a flat share, is moving in a month and I have no savings, no deposit for a new place. I'm worried for my future living 

I struggle most days with either feeling ill or feeling in a bad head state. My Grandad passed away a month ago, he was more of a Dad to me and I haven't processed or dealt with his passing. I feel weak, useless. I'm independent, I want to be able to look after myself. Asking for help is hard for me but I keep having to ask for more and more help, it making me more depressed 

The last few days I've been all over the place. I normally love Christmas with my mum and family but I was so sick I had to come home early and I just broke down that evening. I felt so overwhelmed with everything going on, I couldn't stop crying/having a panic attack for hours 

I'm having a panic attack at least once a day. I've not had this before, but if anyone shouts near me, I get so scared I end up shaking and just breaking down. I do suffer with PTSD, anxiety, depression and boardline personality disorder but I've not had it affect me this badly before 

My thoughts seem to be all over the place. I'm overthinking everything. I'm barely sleeping as my head is filled with so many thoughts, then when I do sleep, I'm having such bad dreams that I keep waking up or just feeling emotional exhausted when I wake up. Everything seems to make me cry but i also feel zoned out/numb and irritated at the same time 

I'm just feeling fed up with keep feeling down, keep worrying about my future/finances, my health and just feeling out of place"
MentalHealthUK,12/28/21 20:06:29,"Critically burnt out now. If I get to a point of recovery, what do I do?","Went into the 2020 pandemic in a pretty vulnerable place and not great headspace, 2021 ramped it up with the most stupid, busiest summer in work. Stress, pressure and an insane amount of extra work whilst understaffed fueled the fire and I could feel it coming on. 
Wrote to work for some time out but before there was chance to press send and discuss the intensity ramped up further, relentless and ended up powering through until a couple of weeks back when it came to a peak and ended up in hospital in a bad way where I’ve been since. (Medical over mental issue)
It’s not looking good for the next year with another horrendous work schedule and an obligation to the team, but I don’t think i can go back.

I live alone, sole bill payer, in a city. Need to be able achieve a wage to atleast to keep a roof over my head and some food coming in. I’m ambitious and need something to keep my brain stimulated.
I have no idea how I’ll do it.

I don’t think I can go work back in that environment again, but that’s been my entire career so far. 

Feeling so lost, confused and should be focusing on getting better but all I can think about is what I have to go back to.

MentalHealthUK,12/28/21 09:20:48,What will happen if I tell my therapist the truth about my mental health?,"I'm in therapy for depression and body dysmorphia. I've never been diagnosed because my doctor said they dont diagnose smaller issues like depression, only serious ones like schizophrenia and to wait and see if my issues pass (told them it's been 6 years of this now). But they referred me to therapy at least and said we're working with ""depressive and body dysmorphic symptoms"".

So I told my therapist I'm feeling insecure about x,y,z, I feel im always being judged, I barely leave my house, I feel so ugly, I feel so low etc. To be honest she's barely available. Shes on holiday quite often, cancels on me a lot of the time.

I haven't told her that I am starving myself, I self harm every day, I cant sleep at night, I have urges to try and fix my flaws like break my nose with a hammer to change the shape, I have a suicide plan and I am intending to act on it soon. I'm worried what will happen to me if I tell them the truth. I need help, and I don't feel like I'm getting the proper help i need without telling them the full extent of my situation. But I'm also worried what would happen if I told them I have a suicide plan and I am intending to act on it and I dont think I can keep myself safe. I dont know what they would do. I cant end up in my local hospital because I volunteer for them, I cant ruin my life like this. I feel like I either need to succeed in suicide or keep absolutely silent about everything. I'm worried. What would potentially happen?"
MentalHealthUK,12/28/21 07:39:46,[27M] Advice for someone feeling alone?,"Hi Reddit,

Apologies for the depressing post but I don't know where to turn.

I'm currently feeling so incredibly alone, I don't have friends to go out with, no friends I can call for a chat or help if I need it. I ended a 7 year relationship recently and have been living alone since.

I've recently started having anxiety attacks which often get worse because I can't call friends to try and calm down. I can call my mother but she works full time and I don't want to bother her but will as a last resort.

My relationship with food is falling apart, I've lost over a stone in 4 weeks and throw up as a result of my anxiety.
It feels like my body is shutting down and I don't know what to do.

I want to try and meet people but I have social anxiety which puts me off even trying. Large groups of new people is a nightmare. I have confidence issues, when someone new does talk to me I assume they don't actually care and are just making small talk.

Childhood grievance and other events has resulted in me shutting down as a coping mechanism. I am having therapy at present to try and find myself, gain confidence etc.

Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome these hurdles? I'm in the North West of England if anyone reading is interested.

If there is a subreddit better suited for this please let me know.

Thank you for your time."
MentalHealthUK,12/28/21 07:09:45,How do you deal with being constantly let down?,"As the title says really.

I find I'm often let down. I grew up with a parent that would just tell you what you wanted to hear and it's massively affected how much I trust and rely on people, combined with abandonment issues I'm definitely hyper-independent. This works a lot of the time but its not practical all of the time so with the help of therapy after a massive breakdown I've been working on asking for help more.. It's hard but especially hard when you try and rely on people and they let you down.

Is it just a common thing? Do people just say they'll do stuff with no intention and expect people to get that? Am I crazy for expecting that if I ask someone for help and they say yeah that they actually mean yeah? And I don't mean if something comes up etc, I understand life happens at times and things change but it's more them saying yes even though they have no intention of following through. I'm totally ok if someone says no or is just honest, I really don't expect people to go out of their way for me even if I do that for people. I get that I'm a people pleaser so am more likely to help others than they are to help me, but why do people lead me on instead of just being honest?

It makes me not want to rely on anyone or trust anyone which sucks and makes me feel isolated and down."
MentalHealthUK,12/28/21 05:11:02,Today is discovered I definitely was born addicted to heroin,"I always knew there was a likelihood this was the case but I always had this hope or belief in my head this was not the case and I just had an insane immunity to drugs.

Today my biological aunt confirmed I definitely was addicted to heroin at birth.

Unfortunately this has had a very drastic reaction in me. I've gone from having this hope it wasn't try to now looking at every completely different.

I've gone from being supportive of social services to full on rage and blame directed at them. They are getting absolute and utter hatred building up in me.

This is going to be a massive read so I'm sorry but I've no idea how else to explain it.

What finding this out for definite now means to me is that social services knew I was being abused before I was born and yet they did nothing.

I use 4yrs old as a timeline because that was the age we were taking from my biological mum but realistically it could have been any time before that.

I have been made to watch my mum and my sister who is 2yrs younger than being raped and forced to watch at 4yrs.

I was physically abused daily, sexually abused, malnurished, neglected as my mum would go away for weeks leaving a 4yr old to keep his younger sister alive whilst she was away injecting poison into her body.

This is where the worst bit comes. Childline were called so many times to help us and refused support by social services and the police that childline stopped responding to the calls because there was nothing they could do.

What it finally took for action to be taken was for this 4yr old boy to grab onto the doorframe at nursery when his mother came to collect him with every bit of strength he had screaming for help. At that point social services stepped in and placed us in foster care.

Yay you would think but no. In my social work files they actually have it documented the foster couple hated me and couldn't cope with me. They abused me mentally every single day.

Eventually we were moved and again yay you'd thin. No. Foster brother tried to make me have sex with my sister. When I reached out and reported this I was called a liar to my face by social services.

I'd also like to add that my mum died when I was 7 from an overdose. Social services told a 7yr old that the reason she did it was because she couldn't have us back. She died because I held onto that door for dear life and they just confirmed it to me. I spent years being called mother killer at school as my sister told everyone I killed my mum.

Bullied every single day and labelled a problem kid who was just a complete waste of time and would never amount to anything at all. Literally that's what I was told daily.

Beaten by teachers who saw me as a problem child and not the boy who was screaming for help.

Not once did anyone try to help me understand, educate me and support me in the slightest.

The abuse doesn't stop there in fact it continues right up to early adulthood. 

This is what learning that I was born addicted to heroin for definite has done to me today.

Sorry for long read and sorry it it's hard reading. I'm not looking for anything just to vent.

Thank you"

This   was  one of the things that hit me in the past few months more and  more,  as  long as we procrastinate, play games 24/7 (not saying games  are bad   though lol), go on tik tok, insta, whatever.

It    makes us feel dull when we spend our time doing nothing. So instead    just pursue what you want to do and the motivation would naturally come    with it."
MentalHealthUK,12/26/21 04:15:50,Xmas on own,"Not really sure on the point of this post, just wanted to write it out somewhere. 

I'd gone down to visit a few family members starting at my half sisters yesterday. I couldn't sleep properly last night and didn't want to have to deal with people feeling rough so i got up and left and made the long journey home during the night, got home had some breakfast and went to bed for a bit. Spent the day on my own, and decided i could head down again Monday for a few days. Went out to get a takeaway and potentially have a car issue which will mean I'm stuck until that's sorted.

I feel like i let the family down by leaving but i could just not face another night of bad sleep and having to deal with people when i felt that way. I haven't seen any of them since xmas pre covid either, which makes me feel worse. 

I don't know anyone where I live except for colleagues and now don't really have an option to do all the visits i wanted to make before returning to work.

If you're wondering why I'm writing this in a mental health subreddit, I've suffered with anxiety and depression for a long time and this has made it a whole lot worse.

MentalHealthUK,12/25/21 22:08:15,Today's unexpected struggles,"Hey everyone, I hope everyone is taking it easy today.

I have always struggled with big groups of people and Christmas is no different. 6 people all having a conversation at the same time shouting over each other to be heard just completely messes my head up big time. I get dizzy turns, pain, fatigue and even sweats.

At Christmas though I can hide it and make it special for the kids etc.

A few months ago I had a major crash. I was completely stuck for a week in a prison cell within my  brain torturing me (best way I can explain it). It took so much out of me fighting this to come out the other side as I felt all the support that was available actually triggered me more.

I've been much better since although still struggle in crowds and stuff but I was back to being able to cover it up and do what was needed.

I have 3 young kids (4,3 and 2yrs old) and one of my wife's friends who comes every year has a mild form of downsyndrome and my wife's dad and another friend who also suffers sever depression and anxiety.

I'm not being judgemental or discriminate again anyone with learning difficulties but we clash. Due to her leaning disabilities and lack of understanding about social barriers she is always in my space and screams when talking and what's even harder is she has to talk no matter what it is. For example I took my shoes of and she says ""did you take your shows off"" which just triggers me. Irrational I know but what part of mental health isn't irrational.

Anyway this has been a very difficult days for me mentally. I'm literally hiding in the bathroom to get a bit of space to recover before I go back and try and join in. I'm exhausted, sore, in pain, dizzy and just not really here at all mentally.

I'm irritated and really struggling not to tell people to shut up. I keep asking people to turn the volume down a bit but it just seems to make some people louder and louder until my actual ears are ringing.

I'm not posting to look for sympathy or anything but rather how that crash could have done this to me when I've been feeling as normal as I felt before the crash? Has it literally just been lingering around waiting to rear it's ugly head again when my barriers are already weakened or is it more likely it's not actually that crash and just a combination of other things? 

This constantly trying to understand yourself does get very tiring especially when new things or slight changed just pop up every now and then.

Unfortunately I've been told no antidepressant will work for my complex ptsd because it's all too complex (whatever that means) but I'm holding onto a bit of hope that the counselling will actually do something to help even if just a little bit.

Anyway everyone enjoy yourself as much as you can whether it's doing the norm or just being you.

Take care"

MentalHealthUK,12/25/21 09:22:35,How can I ever deal with trauma related to an abusive relationship if the only therapy I can get is CBT?,"I’m 31, had constant moderate mental health issues since I was 15. Moderate meaning long term, constant suicidal thoughts, and make my quality of life significantly worse, but I’ve never attempted suicide, been institutionalised or on long term sick from work etc.

Got great help through CAMHS as a teenager and been in and out of therapy since then.

The biggest issue I really need to tackle is dealing with the legacy of an abusive relationship I got trapped in a few years ago. I can’t actually have romantic relationships anymore because of this baggage- haven’t had one in over five years.

But the only type of therapy I can expect on the NHS is CBT. It’s been of limited use in the past. I’m now soon to receive specialised CBT which is specifically for autistic people (I’m autistic), but it’s still just CBT. My question is, how am I ever going to be able to deal with this trauma when CBT is essentially just about managing the symptoms of mental health problems? If I bring up my past relationship in a CBT session, the therapist is just going to say “okaaay so how can we change your thought patterns so you DONT think about your horrible experience?”. Which may have short term value, but is useless when it comes to stuff like having another relationship.

For more context I live in London, on a low income, absolutely no ‘affordable’ private therapy available. Also there are zero resources for biological men (I’m non binary and ‘technically’ male) who have suffered relationship abuse (some helplines have been good for me, but no long term support- they just say to look for low cost therapy).

Any advice is appreciated!"

MentalHealthUK,12/24/21 20:39:05,How a bird pooping triggered my mental health,"A few days ago I was having a pee. Being a bloke I can do this standing up lol.

My bathroom window is clear glass but you can only see from my shoulders up and I'm 6ft 2in.

I was looking out the window and spotted a crow sitting on the fence as they do when it just did a poo and flew off.

My head was literally amazed at what it must feel like to not even give it a second thought. I have lots of bowel issues and anxiety related to those.

I can't go to the toilet outwith my home or family home I'm comfortable with so I have to plan every journey from the day before which means I don't eat anything and have to watch my fluid intake.

This then triggered thinking about why I had these hangups about something that everyone has to do and there is no shame in doing natural body functions.

I started to remember the comments made if you were in the toilet at school or people standing at the bathroom door shouting through at you to hurry up and making assumptions at what I was doing.

I then started to think about one time when I was about 16. I was very skinny throughout my childhood and I had hangups about that but this one girl about the same age saw me with my top off. The way I was sitting made it look as though I had a flabby tummy you know leaning forward scrunching my gut up.

I remember at the time thinking what? I was actually quite angry and offended. The particular girl in question was actually overweight and I remember thinking even back then I would never comment on her weight so why did she think it was okay to plant this horrible thought in my head.

This is just the perfect example of how something so small and insignificant to the vast majority of people is actually a lot more to some of us because what some people see as a bird having a poo I see as me having so many issues over even the basics.

It does make you realise how difficult these illnesses are and people need to start realising that every joke to you can be upsetting and offensive to others.

I'm not making out I've never been guilty of this myself because I have in my past. I've become more understanding and aware as I've grown older and actually understood the impacts of very small things can have on others."
MentalHealthUK,12/24/21 19:00:30,How to get the right medication?,"Hello everyone,

As I'm sure most of you also feel, I've become lost in the system of mental health care. I've been diagnosed with bipolar since 16/17 and have been bounced from clueless GP to CAHMS and back as a teenager. When I was 19 I left CAHMS as I felt I was in a better place and didn't wanna take up that slot for someone who needed it more. Now I'm 25 and stopped taking medication a year or so ago because I was fed up with the strong side effects. I've come to realise that I'm going to have to be on medication if I want to carry on, realistically. 

In February this year I called the GP and told them I need to see a specialist who can help me find the right medication. They said they've sent a referral to CAHMS, I've been around this for so long I knew it would be a long, long wait but still nothing. 

I hate going to a GP about this because the last 2 I've had didn't understand bipolar enough to really help and just picked a medication of their computer list to try. I've been on 2 now, both weren't great and the time it takes to adjust and then the withdrawal symptoms that come with changing put me off just trying one for the sake of it.

So I'm asking, how do I find someone who can help me get on the correct medicine for me and the right dosage etc?

Thanks so much, Merry Christmas."
MentalHealthUK,12/24/21 09:08:13,Support in Surrey?,"Is there any way to get support/therapy if on minimum wage? I've already received 2x6 hours of NHS therapy but due to my trust issues didn't manage to fully open up and think I'd require a more long term option.

Are there any online therapists that charge less? Any overseas ones? I think I'm just desperate to get help to deal with my emotions as they're all over the place and I don't know what to do with them, but then when I have therapy I pretend I'm feeling ok

MentalHealthUK,12/23/21 18:00:48,Here's my attempt to explain mental health from my view,"Mental health to me is no different to physical health in some aspects.

We don't go to the Dr and say my physical health is bad and they give us a magic pill that cures all physical health issues. Each physical health problem has its own path of stuff to help make us better. Treatment for a broken leg is not the same treatment for lung cancer.

Mental health is just the same. There are so many types of mental health issues. Some very obvious and some very discreet but they're very different.

What helps complex PTSD won't be something that helps Alzheimer's or ADHD. Not only that my complex ptsd will be different to the person's next to me and as such needs specialised help for each individual person.

The vast majority of us with mental health issues will be able to relate to aspects of mental health that we all mostly suffer like those days of no motivation or runaway thoughts.

Mental health in my opinion is on a completely different scale to physical health though. I suffer a lot of chronic illnesses both physical and mental and the mental health ones are much more complicated.

Physical health has clear and obvious signs that we can or can't do something due to physical restrictions but we understand that. Mental health doesn't have such obvious signs and we don't fully understand or should I say accept these limitations.

We keep telling ourselves get on with it or we better do stuff to suit other people which in turn makes us worse whereas with physical health difficulties we would be far more likely to explain we can't do something because my body isn't well. Not always though as I still push my body and mind to do stuff but I definitely am more concerned about my physical than mental.

Mental health is not ""visible"" either so we are constantly questioning it and thinking about what others think. I put visible in brackets because people who look at me can see I'm exhausted or they can gauge my mood but that's about it.

Mental health is a absolute minefield. It takes much more work and effort to get through and the process can take decades and never truly be away.

Mental health is life limiting in much more aspects. I get physical chronic pain, chronic fatigue, confusion, lack of attention and focus, obsessions and the worse one is the self worth and hate.

Going to the Dr that first time for help for anything is difficult for most of us but mental health is on a completely different level."
MentalHealthUK,12/23/21 15:59:40,"The ""positives"" of mental health","Hi everyone,

I want to just introduce myself before going through this.

I am 43yrs old and I've had a really difficult life. I was born addicted to heroin so my abuse started before I was even born.

Unfortunately those most vulnerable are easier targets throughout our lives so my life didn't get any better right up to early adulthood. The difference was the types of abuse by different people.

At 23 I finally found a girlfriend who was what I had been dreaming for. Stability, no abuse and most importantly accepting of my struggles. 

I still struggle with mental health and in fact it's got worse since my health rapidly declined. I live with multiple chronic illnesses including having gone through Cancer at 31.

I am sharing my experiences and little things that have helped me get through this horrendous illness. One of those things is looking at the positives of mental health.

It's very hard to look at the positives of something that knocks us down every single day and just won't give us a break but there is positives. We are the most understandable people there is. We understand the struggles people go through more than anyone else.

We want to help end this suffering for others and not just ourselves.

We tend to have the least but willing to give the most.

We look at things completely different to other people.

I know it's hard every single day but we need to take it easy on ourselves. Our healing starts by us starting to realise it's okay to be not well. That's the start of the journey.

Everyone take care"
MentalHealthUK,12/23/21 06:13:03,"I think I need to speak to someone to get myself back on track, but who?","Over the past few years I've had a few rough patches, caused by work and relationships/friendships. 
Somehow I've managed to get through them with no professional support.


I've pretty suddenly hit another rough patch, after a few weeks of struggling. Tonight I feel completely helpless. I'm overthinking, stressing, anxious and I think I need to take things more seriously this time and speak to someone.
I feel very isolated, I only really have one friend these days, everyone else has gone silent on me (part of the trigger for these feelings). I have my family, however I don't feel comfortable talking to them about these things and I don't think they really understand me anymore, as much as I do love them.


I feel stuck with no one to talk to or hang out with to distract and calm myself down.


I think I need to look at speaking to a therapist, as I can't see the rollercoaster of emotions changing anytime soon and I can't keep spending every day and night worrying. 
What's the best way to speak anonymously to someone? I'd rather my family didn't know about it, so ideally someone I could message, as right now I'm stuck at home for the christmas and new year break. I have no idea where to begin looking?

I've been depressed 20 years and tried multiple interventions and have been on a variety of medications and counselling variations for years. Nothing has worked.

MentalHealthUK,12/22/21 03:16:42,Worried that antidepressants don’t work well in me,"Hello, as the title says, I’m worried that no antidepressants will work well in me.

For about 2 years, since December 2019, I took citalopram because I had problems sleeping due to anxiety. It worked and I slept better. However, over time I required a higher and higher dose. I theorise this is because I was becoming tolerant to it. Eventually, it reached a point where I was on maximum dose (40mg) but I was still having sleep problems. This was a few months ago.

So I then decided to try sertraline. It was completely disastrous. Not only did sertraline do nothing to make my anxiety better, but it actually made it worse, and even gave me NEW anxiety symptoms that I’d never experienced before! Specifically I got panic attacks, chest pain and feeling faint, which I never got before. I know these symptoms are due to sertraline because when I came off it, they went away. Bear in mind these problems still persisted after 8 weeks on sertraline, so it’s not like I didn’t give it time to work. 

This leaves me confused because why did I have such a different response to citalopram and sertraline when they do the same thing? I know they’re different drugs but I wouldn’t expect THIS drastically different a response.

I saw a psychiatrist and he said I need a strongly anxiolytic antidepressant. He also said that it’s time to move to a different class of drug, given that SSRIs didn’t work that well in me. So he prescribed me Mirtazapine.

I’m on my second day of Mirtazapine and I’m worried I’m gonna end up the same way as sertraline. What if citalopram is the only antidepressant that works in me and the rest don’t work? And it didn’t even work well enough. Because different people respond differently right? 

With my Mirtazapine, shortly after I take it I feel completely wiped out, I feel dissociated (zoned out, unable to focus) and I feel like everything is going in slow motion. I also feel quite restless/ agitated and more angry than usual. Is this normal, or is this a sign that it’s not gonna work in me? Because I’ve heard that you can tell from the early side effects whether an antidepressant is gonna work in someone or not.

With sertraline, I put up with the awful side effects WAY too long before finally asking to come off it. So this time, I don’t wanna make the same mistake. If the Mirtazapine is not gonna work in me, I need to know, so I can ask to be taken off it ASAP. Because otherwise it’s a waste of time if I’m on a drug that doesn’t work at all for me (like sertraline). 

Your thoughts?"

He said that he felt he wasn't qualified to help me and I need professional help. I know that so badly. If you look in my post history, I have been constantly trying to get help. I know I need therapy, preferably DBT. It kills, because what else could I have done? I search for help in other people, ie partners and friends because I can't get it elsewhere. But then they leave because my problems are too much for them. 


I understand that when your significant other is waking up and crying for hours every day and can't get out of bed I see how it takes a toll. Especially when we are young (I'm 21) and all my friends and partners are dealing with similar issues.

I was very interested and somewhat hopeful this could mean the UK will eventually start to accept that there is exceptional value to be had in changing the way we treat mental health on the whole. SSRI's and the like only work on the minority of people, and should only be used short term (less than three years) and yet they're being handed out like sweets right now, for a host of reasons.  A huge pharma like this investing multi billions into the future of treatments by utilising the essential (beneficial) effects of cannabis cannot be underplayed.

MentalHealthUK,12/20/21 01:44:09,C-PTSD official diagnosis???,"I have spoken to several different therapists over the years and each one has always said I most likely have CPTSD. But I only ever went to those therapists to make other people happy and so never listened to them. 

A couple of months ago I started seeing a new therapist, but this was the first time I went without anyone else pushing me to and with the intention of trying to get better. This therapist has also said I most likely have CPTSD, and is recommending that I speak to a doctor to start the process of trying to get an official diagnosis of this. After getting misdiagnosed so many times with lots of different mental conditions in order to try and explain my PTSD, I have never found any benefit of getting a diagnosis and so was wondering what you guys think, and what your experiences have been? Did you find the stress and anxiety (I get extremely anxious around doctors, idk why) of getting a diagnosis worth it for the benefits you got from that diagnosis? Or did you find no real change in your treatment or anything else once you got the diagnosis and so think you might as well, carried on like before. 

I have no problem getting treatment and support for my problems (I am already on daily SSRIs and obv am seeing a therapist weekly), but I am aware that most of the things doctors can do to help like meds, therapy, etc can all be accessed without a diagnosis of CPTSD specifically (I already have a general anxiety and depression diagnosis) and so i am just wondering if there was a benefit to getting a specific diagnosis of CPTSD on your medical records?? 

I also wanted to quickly ask... I hate speaking to new people about my PTSD in person (like a doctor) because I feel a lot of shame and guilt for not actually having experienced any trauma first hand, I only witnessed it done to others a lot when I was younger. And so I always find talking to medical professionals really stressful because of this. Is anyone else in the same boat as me? Does anyone else have CPTSD without having received any trauma to themselves but almost entirely through witnessing it be done to others that are close to you??? 

Thank you for your help 🙂

I currently live at home, I think the next step for me is to move out but I cannot work due to severe depression and social anxiety. There are some problems at home due to a drug addicted sibling.

UCredit suggest you rent privately. I am already in receipt of disability benefits via UCredit but after using a few of their calculators it appears a basic room to rent in either my local town or the nearest city come to more than the total allowance. 

So I don't really understand - have I made a mistake or is it impossible to access housing for me unless I begin a full time job? I am chronically suicidal and cannot do this yet, but I feel moving out and being more independent would at least get me a step towards it.

Idk if the post made sense or if this is the wrong sub,sorry

I just found out that people can have their referrals rejected, and now I'm trying to figure out how you will know if you are rejected?

I rang up my city's talking therapies service who after doing a phone assessment decided to refer me to NHS psychology. They warned me of a waiting time of at least 14 months (which I was NOT expecting, but I will take it for free care) I received a letter from them stating:  
""I confirm that I have now added your name to the Psychology waiting list for treatment. An appointment will be offered in due course...""  


Now I've been waiting for over 7 months since then, and its been extremely draining. I do worry now though, is this confirmation of a future appointment? or can the NHS just randomly send me a letter after 14 months of waiting and say I have been rejected? 

\*also might be worth noting that I self referred through the NHS talking therapies site, rather than through my GP\*  
I honestly have no idea about these kinds of services, so if anyone can also advise me, what is NHS psychology? is that like an umbrella term for all kinds of therapy, or is this specialist in some way? overall I'm just not fully understanding how the process works and I have nothing else to do while waiting other than obsessively try and research what could happen.

MentalHealthUK,12/19/21 06:25:26,Feeling stupid calling the crisis team.,"I have a CPN with the CMHT. I suffer a lot of symptoms of BPD, some OCD and the general anxiety that comes with both. 

A few things have happened over the past couple of days which would be small annoyances to most people, but all my emotions are dialled up to 11. I can feel that the small things have built up and now I'm starting to get snappy, wish I was dead, feel detached, feel paranoid, wanting to be alone, ruminating etc. Things I know will lead to a crisis. 

The stuff that has happened is so stupid that it puts me off calling the crisis team because I perceive that they will roll their eyes and think I'm wasting their time. I already know that I'm not supposed to think like this and that they're there for me to use when I need them, no matter the reason. But it's like I'm hardwired to believe they will think badly of me.

Last year was rough and the lockdown meant I couldn't travel home to see my mum. This year is even worse being halfway around the world from my parents and with it costing a fortune to go there (even if they weren't travel bans). 

Haven't had much luck connecting with people here, and I doubt any of them would want to hang out now when they'd rather spend the season with their close friends and family. It's not like I'd be able to go into the office either, as they'll be locking up the building from the end of next week. I mean sure I can keep working from home, but gosh that's a sad existence.

I recently celebrated my birthday. Well, when I say celebrated, I mean I took a day off work. What hurt was that no one remembered or even said happy birthday, and it got me thinking, gosh I must be a terrible friend or just a terrible person to he so forgettable. I try to be kind and helpful and be someone people like to know but perhaps I'm just garbage to be discarded when unwanted. 

I wish I knew how to be better so that I could make those real connections and be someone people want in their lives. Feeling unwanted and worthless just sucks.

MentalHealthUK,12/19/21 04:27:17,Admitted Into A UK Adolescent Psychiatric Ward For Two Months.,"
Hi.

I’ve finally been discharged from the psych ward and thought that I might aswell share my experience.

The reason I was admitted was because I have been suffering with depression and anxiety for over four years and eventually attempted to take my own life.

On my admission date, four different staff members had to search me and my luggage. 

All patients had their own ensuite. 

We had anti-suffocation bedding, anti-ligature curtains, windows that would only open a few inches, TV’s locked in by screws, plastic mirrors, ‘emergency call’ buttons in every bedroom and everything was sloped. 

The ward that I was admitted to had a daily schedule that would be encouraged for us to follow.

At 08:00, staff members wake us up. 
They would open the windows, take our bedsheets, take away person items and ward privileges… do anything to get us out of bed. 

Once we have woken up, we’re encouraged to take a shower, but not many of us actually manage to do so.

We have time until 09:00 to have breakfast, if we miss the deadline, we have to wait until 10:30 for snacks. 

At 09:00, we have education. 
Most of us just sit and do whatever we feel like, there wasn’t much pressure to actually complete work.

At 10:30, we have snacks. 
If we miss snack-time, we would have to wait for lunch at 12:00.

At 11:00, we go back to education, until lunch-time.

At 12:00, we have our lunch. 
If we miss lunch, we need to wait for snacks at 16:00.

From 13:00 to 16:00, we have group activities and therapy sessions that vary throughout the week.

At 16:00, we have snacks. 
If we miss snack-time, we wait until dinner at 18:00.

After 16:00, we’re allowed to ask for our electronic devices that are kept in a locked room by staff or we can just have ‘free-time’ and hang out with the other patients.

At 18:00, we have dinner. 
If we miss dinner, we wait for snack-time at 20:30.

After dinner, we can continue with our ‘free-time’.

At 20:30, we have our last snack-time of the day.
If we miss snacks, we have to wait for the next morning to have  breakfast.

After 20:30, our ‘free-time’ continues, until our bedtime, which depends on our age.
The latest bedtime we had was until 23:00.

On specific days, we would have time to do our laundry and change our bedding.

And that’s pretty much the whole week summed up.

It definitely wasn’t the best experience, but I honestly believe that I have benefited from it.

The positives are:
-creates a daily structure and routine for productivity.
-working on your mental-health.
-making friends that relate to you.



The negatives are: 
-seeing and hearing other patients having incidents and those incidents triggering yourself.
-the staff are quite unreliable.
-depending on the type of patients, they may say hurtful things to you and others around them or even try to physically harm you.   


Feel free to ask me any questions.

Hope this helped.

MentalHealthUK,12/19/21 01:24:17,"Does anyone else get nervous for weekends, bank holidays and special occasions?","Let me briefly explain. So you know how the mental health teams are open pretty much all year round expect when it's weekends, bank holidays, and special occasions like Christmas and Easter? Like the people you might have regular contact with, like your care coordinator, your psychologist, etc. It's like when it's those specific days or occasions and you know you can't contact them and have to wait until it's the weekday again (unless it's bak holiday Monday). 

It just causes me a lot of anxiety knowing that they're not on stand-by and that when I feel low I haven't got a professional to talk to. Can anyone relate to this? Like I know they can't be on stand-by forever and I know the crisis team is around, but the crisis team always mostly say to me call the crisis cafe. And there's my rigid thinking that if they're not NHS staff they can't help me! I think that could be my autism that makes me think like that."

MentalHealthUK,12/18/21 20:38:43,About to restart counselling with same counsellor last seen in 2019. Should I or should I see someone else?,"I'm about to restart counselling sessions with counsellor last seen in 2019. I stopped because I was too anxious to book another and I was also getting frustrated that all I could do was vent about how crappy my life was. Every session the same thing. My life sucks. I hate where I live. I hate my noisy neighbours. I hate my life. Etc. etc.

I started seeing her in 2017 because I had a mental crisis after getting into a stupid fight on a bus and losing my ex-flatmates cat. Both of those were preceded by (3 years earlier) me being defrauded of my life savings by my best friend who I'd let stay in my flat, rent-free, while I went travelling. I did eventually get the money back from the bank in 2018 but everyone I turned to for help didn't (Multiple free legal advice centres turned me away because the money was too much. Several law firms did the same when I said the word 'Bank'). Only person who did help was my local MP and that took two visits and his team fucking up a description of what happened before the bank finally refunded me the money.

I got in contact with her because another counsellor I talked to said that I didn't have enough money to pay and that it'd be best for me to find someone else. When I did finally talk to her over the phone I started crying, seriously ugly crying. Eventually, after getting turned away from yet another free legal advice charity, and with her encouragement, I went to my GP and asked for meds.

The GP gave me two weeks of Citalopram, 2 weeks of Diazepam and the words 'Come back if you feel like taking some more'. So that's what I did and, despite pushback from the Receptionist, got two more weeks of Citalopram. What I didn't get was a warning on how bad coming off them would be. I noticed I had run out and decided to call the GP the next day. Next day comes and I'm in a big black pit of despair.

Eventually the CMHT gets in touch and, after talking to someone who wasn't the Psychiatrist, the Psychiatrist prescribes Sertraline. Which promptly zombifies me. After that I decided to go private and got prescribed Citalopram again by a private GP practice. According to the first GP they can't do long term presciptions but can do one every three months. So that's what I do. Despite the practice repeatedly losing any trace of my records. That finally ended in Jan/Feb of this year when I finally couldn't bare telling the same GP the same thing for the fifth time in a row about how much I was taking and yes I have been seeing you for over a year now. And all that over a Zoom call to boot.

Throughout this I'd been going to counselling sessions and mostly using them to vent my spleen. While she has encouraged me to pursue my interests (I signed up for a two year BTEC in Filmmaking which I promptly dropped out of after three months because I hated it and one of the teachers) I don't know that I got much out of the sessions with her.

Which is my problem. I don't know. I don't know how to deal with my problems. I don't know how to be self-directed. I don't know how to organise the mess that is my life. I don't know how to cope with a bleak future. I don't know how to deal with a painful past. I just don't know.

What I do know is that I'm in pain. When I'm with people I feel alone and when I'm alone I feel like crying. I'm afraid of the future and the pain that it will bring. I'm afraid of the past and the pain that it was filled with. I'm afraid of the present and the pain it's inflicting on me.

I know that there is a pattern to my life. I get interested in something. I study it obsessively, maybe take a course in it. Fail. Move on. It's been this way since I left secondary school. I went to Sixth Form to study Art, Philosophy, and Politics solely because my parents (Mostly Mum) elbowed me into it (""Of course you can take a break after sixth form. You can decide what you want to do then""). Failed that so miserably that one of the AS exams came back ""Unmarked"".

Got elbowed by my Mum into a sales assistant job which I quit after five months (I hated the commute). Got elbowed by my Mum into studying a BTEC in Computing. Failed that, wasting two years of my life. Got elbowed by my Mum into a job working for London Underground (Hence the username). Somehow manage to get up and go to work for four years till Mum passed away. Am pressured by Fuckhead Manager Luke into coming back before I'm ready.

Soon after I get taken for a ride by couple of homeless people with a sob story (Same one every homeless person has, they're homeless), losing my life savings to them over a period of two years. Get an inheritance from Mum. Lose the inheritance from Mum. See the pattern yet?

I'm now 36 years old and with nothing to show for it. No life. No job. And only two people I can call friend after 36 years of being alive. I know I have Dyspraxia (aka Developmental Coordination Disorder) and I've long suspected that I'm Autistic (Dad didn't want to hear it), but after watching a couple of Youtube videos about ADHD I suspect I might have that (Dad probably won't want to hear that either).

What do I do? I find it hard to talk about this face to face. Even with her. I tend to shut down when stressed and this is all very stressful. I was ready to ask her if we could restart counselling sessions back in June/July but couldn't face asking. I started writing an email to her in August and only sent it this month.

Normally I'd just shutdown, ignore my problems, and focus on anything else. Watch Youtube. Play a computer game. Read a dozen books. But that's failing. Youtube has turned into nothing but a series of things I've either seen or don't want to watch. I can't play computer games perfectly and when I can't play perfectly I get frustrated and pissed off. And when I'm frustrated and pissed off I have a tendency to break stuff. I'm afraid of breaking yet another laptop. I can't read physical books because of the light and noise from my surroundings. I can't read eBooks because Amazon has ""helpfully"" changed the interface making my Kindle hard to use. And even before then it was only showing me things I didn't want to buy (Nine books by the same writer? Come on!).

I can see why people start drinking, but I don't want to get worse. I want to get better. So what do I do? 

TL;DR: About to restart counselling with counsellor last seen in 2019. Should I or should I see someone else?"
MentalHealthUK,12/18/21 15:42:21,I don’t know who I am anymore,"

Since As long as I can remember I have had no personality no feelings nothing, feeling like this body isn’t mine or I’m in a dream then suddenly snapping out of it.  I change who I am to please others, the worst part is Ik I am doing it as I am doing it it feels like I don’t even have control. I feel anxious but I don’t it’s weird I can only describe it as a fog of protection over my fragile mind that blocks any bad emotion gettting to my head.  The only time I feel like “myself” is through drugs.  1 suicide attempt which obviously didn’t plan how I wanted it to. 

I find it hard caring about anyone or anything that is happening to them, even close ones like friends and family. Even down to dark things happening like one of their family members or even someone close to me dying or something I really find it hard to give a shit. Even writing that disgusts me.

Horrific hygiene and Ik about it and I do not care. Can’t remember last time i brushed my teeth.

It feels like I’m watching a film, watching myself get worse and worse, and for some reason I want it to get worse. I’m not even the main character in this fucked up screenplay

MentalHealthUK,12/18/21 00:48:05,Advice regarding isolating and mental health,"As you know at the moment I’m currently isolating as mentioned in my last post. Absolutely fine doing this because I still have the freedom moving around my house and to go for cigarettes. 

But now the trust have come back today for all the houses about new policies. Basically we’re only allowed out for essential shopping and to smoke on site. We’re only allowed one visitor up here for a max of an hour and that has to be booked in.

Well to top it off on top providing I remain negative, I’ll be able to go home for Christmas but as soon as I’m back here I’ll have to isolate again and that’s just only into my room. Atm they can’t even give us a definite on how long that would be they’re saying maybe 3 days but it could be 10+.

Now I’m pretty stable, but my concern is what if I go back down being kept in my room for too long. I do hallucinate as it is, and usually they’re more active when I’m alone. I can generally handle them when I am in my room for say a couple hours but for the most part I avoid being in there for so long because sometimes they can get wild. 

The other thing is I do notice when I don’t go out for long periods of time my agoraphobia gets a bit irritated I guess is the word to say, in the sense of those emotions I have about leaving seem to start increasing and I start thinking about worst case scenarios if I was to go into a shop that I’ve used regularly. 

I know my family would probably understand if I don’t go for Christmas and I have done 2 christmases in the past couple of years without them even to the extent of not seeing them for ages before and after Christmas, and back then I was only really able to call once a day. I know if I did isolation I could call more, as they’re probably going to be off work for a good few days, but I’m worried this won’t be enough, I know I could also book them in to visit me if I don’t go for Christmas, but that would only allow one visitor. 

So I’m a bit torn on what I do? Has anyone else had to isolate for so long in their room and not have access to their whole house?
I mean what would you do? 

To clarify if this makes any difference I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, EUPD and they suspect I have C-PTSD."

I work long hours and am mostly exhausted when I come back home so there isn't much time for me to have a side hussle (I still am trying to earn some money on the side but it's spare change really). 
I have no idea how people cope, I don't want to have kids, I can't imagine how people do it anyway in this economy lol seems impossible, I can barely afford myself haha.

This post is just me venting, I'm not asking for any advice. I guess lots of people are in the same boat.... How to be satisfied with your life living like this?"
MentalHealthUK,12/17/21 13:20:05,First trip to A&amp;E,"Just had my first trip to A &amp; E tonight as the totally crazy guy, thank god I'm not really capable of being embarrassed right now 😅.   Poor lad from the home treatment team just accidentally phoned me instead of someone else, very confusing but would have made an epic prank.   7 / 1 0 would do again.

MentalHealthUK,12/17/21 03:30:04,"I can't get the medication I need, am suicidal and literally begging NHS MH services for help","I've had 2 overdoses, repeated suicidal thoughts (really really bad and considered carrying it out over the last few days). After the OD 2 months ago I was referred by my GP (and it was 'hurried' by another at the same surgery) to the psychiatrist. 2 months later I had no correspondence which I thought was weird but o well. But then on Monday evening I went to A&amp;E because I was going to kms. They said they had no record of the referral, but assured me the psychiatrist office would call me the following day. If not me, my father.

The call never came :(

So I'm completely abandoned by NHS. I have strong strong suicidal ideation like an hourly battle to survive, so an SSRI etc will not cut it (healthcare profs are aware of this, but they are not in the authority to prescribe anything 'harder'). I need an MAOI or a mood stabilizer but I can't even get the appointment for the appointment... I honestly might not be alive this time next month. 

Is there seriously no way to fast-track access this stuff on NHS? This isn't the first time for me, I'm known to the MH services. 

(btw, I'm posting a letter tomorrow to the psych office, but it's going to be months and months to even speak with him. I just need a serious life-saving med, I might not have the time to wait for this)

Sorry for long, meandering, non-proof read post. Thx"
MentalHealthUK,12/17/21 02:04:26,Question for those who are still living with their parents..,"Have any of you ever tried to move out of your parents’ place, but had to move back in due to struggling with anxiety or trouble dealing with the change? 

I’m 28 and still live with my mum, and while I’m still independent even so, I can’t see myself leaving any time soon because I’m unfit for work due to mental health. I know it’s generally frowned upon in general for people my age to still live with your folks, or people get judged for it, so it helps if I know there are others in the same boat."
MentalHealthUK,12/16/21 22:59:42,Best diet for clinical depression + (other issues)?,"Hey all,

I'm morbidly obese. I really want to lose weight, but I love food way too much. I feel like I need to change, but I need to do it for good - not just for a while. I have asked my GP to refer me to a dietitian, but truth be told I already know what I should and shouldn't eat. Anyway, I really want to be slim and feel happier in myself. I've been saying since 2018 that I'll lose weight and never did. I want next year to be different. I want to stop being morbidly obese. I want to feel better and become more active.

My current diet consists of a lot of takeaways. So I eat a lot of McDonald's, KFC, sushi, kebabs, etc. I feel like I won't be able to live without these foods. I feel they are my comfort. However, I know these foods are slowly killing me and although I can reverse it, I feel addicted to them now. I feel like if I don't have these foods, I won't be able to cope.

I want to change, but am scared to because I've known this life on and off for nearly 10-years. Back in 2015 I lost 4-stone - but gained it all again. I know losing weight won't solve everything, but it might make me feel a bit more happier?

I don't drink a lot of water and fluids. That's probably my downfall as well. 

Any advice is appreciated."

MentalHealthUK,12/16/21 13:21:05,Confidentiality,I’m 16 and I have a few scars along both my arms. I’m probably going to be asked to do a blood test in a few hours and I was wondering if the doctors can say anything to my parents without my consent.
MentalHealthUK,12/16/21 04:39:46,Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts?,"It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or, maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. 

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.  
 

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.  
 

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.  
   
 

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.  
 

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**  
 

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?  
   
 

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**"
MentalHealthUK,12/15/21 18:12:33,I don’t know what to do with my MH anymore,"Hi everyone. Thanks for reading. 

Since my dad died when I was 7, I’ve felt depressed. Since the bullying at school due to physical deformity, I feel worthless. Since grinding through college… university and ending up stack shelves, I feel like a failure. 

I first went my to GP 3 years ago. He said I had a ‘low mood’ prescribed Sertraline 10mg and later put me on Citalopram 20mg instead. I’ve been to 1on1 cbt therapy. I’ve been to group cbt therapy. And I am currently under help from a charity called Vitaminds who after reviewing me for an hour, sent me to cbt. 


What do I do to feel better? I write this from work. Once again tearing up in the aisles as I feel completely worthless. I don’t know how to keep pushing anymore Reddit. It seems no one wants to help. No one wants to listen. Everyone just tells me how I feel, how I should be feeling and why I shouldn’t be feeling like that. It doesn’t help. I don’t want drugs or medication, I just want to feel like life is exciting again. That one day I can enjoy life rather than feeling out of place in any situation. I don’t even know why I wrote this. I just know my friends or family will only tell me I’m wrong for feeling this way. 


Thanks for letting me rent I guess"
MentalHealthUK,12/15/21 05:11:49,Infection control not necessarily covid but stressing me out,"To give context I live in a mental health rehab hospital - this is not the same as a secure ward and 99% of the patients are informal. We do all have some form of mental health problems but deemed not under an urgent need of care like in a secure ward. 

It is staff managed 24/7 and we are covid tested every week. Staff I believe more as they’re NHS staff. Most if not all of us are covid vaccinated.

Going on to my point one of the girls recently had to isolate as she was in contact with someone who had a positive test. She stuck by everything the trust said and I wasn’t overly worried as when I did see her at a distance she always had negative tests (I think they were testing every day), so I never had any concerns. She stayed in isolation for 14 days regardless. 

Come to today and I notice our infection/isolation trolley is outside one of the rooms downstairs and the staff confirmed this other patient who lives in my house had to isolate and at the moment we’re not entirely sure for how long (I imagine it will be the same as the last lady - 14 days). The girl has left her room and gone towards the kitchen and now she’s walked through the lounge and gone outside and I don’t know if she’s coming back and she’s not been wiping anything or wearing a mask.

I’m meant to be seeing my parents tomorrow and my aunt lives with them and both my mum and aunt were one of those under the shielding list and now I’m getting stressed that I won’t be able to see them tomorrow and now even more so worried whether my pcr test is going to pick up anything when I have it meaning I’ll have to isolate all over Christmas.

I am gonna tell staff how upset I am about it but I literally feel gutted now because someone was so selfish. On top of it - I have asthma and I know breathlessness has been an issue with people when they have covid so that worries me, and I know some people do have no symptoms but I’m just so angry."

MentalHealthUK,12/14/21 22:25:00,I'm 29 and feel every decision I've made in life is wrong.,"Just like in title, I've reached 29 and everything in my life feels wrong I feel so lost and confused about how to proceed.

I left school becuase family thought it was a good idea to have a trade and went into an apprenticeship with a local builder who was abusive mentally on a daily basis, but I stuck with it for everyone's sake.

I didn't manage to complete college becuase a recession happened and the builder I was working for didn't care for helping me achieve my full NVQ. 

I left shortly after becuase I grew sick of the abuse but ended up on another building site with a freind that helped me out immensely. After that contract ended we have ended up on another site together but much more complex work, I feel immensely over my head and won't even turn up without my freind there to help, it's giving me immense anxiety to the point where I've had 2 nervous breakdowns in the last month. 

My partner has been really supportive but I can see it's affecting her seeing me like this. I have savings in place and I'm debating changing career entirely, but the thought scares me to death and I don't know where to turn for solid advice.

The whole ordeal has me in a complete mess, I go to bed late to prolonge the day as long as possible, and I wake up late becuase I'm dreading facing another one.
I've lost interest in things I used to love and I just don't want to do anything on a daily basis.

Only reason I'm posting here is I've nowhere left to turn, and maybe someone with some insight can help."

I have been alone for many years. I live in a small, shitty town and don't drive so I'm extremely isolated. I have no idea how to go out and make friends due to where I live. I've just had enough to be honest. Loneliness eats away at you until there isn't a person left."

Hi everyone! I am a Doctoral Clinical Psychology researcher based at Newcastle University. My research involves learning about why autistic people are at increased risk of suicide. I want to see whether risk factors that we know are important in non-autistic people are relevant for autistic people. Additionally, the study will look to extend this by exploring risk factors thought to be more significant for autistic people.

You should have a diagnosis of autism (self-diagnosed is ok too) and be able to complete the survey independently. We would like you to answer a series of questions about different topics, including your personality, mental health wellbeing and suicidal thoughts and behaviours.

I want to tell my boss so that he understands why I need a couple of days off, because my head is spinning and I don't know whether I feel numb or terrified or angry or devastated or what. But is that a fucked up thing to share with a boss? Do I just give some random excuse tomorrow, or do I tell the truth?

MentalHealthUK,12/13/21 04:39:25,Feeling ashamed about my MH issues,"Hi,

I know this is daft and completely the wrong way to think, but I have been feeling more and more shame recently about my MH issues. I feel that I am a weak and pathetic person and this makes me really resent myself. Whenever I cry or get emotional in front of others I feel a sense of embarrassment and I berate myself for it. I tell myself I am being a crybaby and I should man up. Again, I know it's wrong to think this way. I know it's a stupid way to think, but I can't help it. 

The funny thing is I'd be the first to tell someone else there is no shame in having a mental health issue and it doesn't make you a weak person, but I can't seem to apply that to myself. I hate how I react to things and I hate how I ""allow"" silly little things to snowball in my mind. I see myself as emotionally and mentally feeble. A pitiful excuse of a person. I remember how I was a child and I was pathetically sensitive (I think I was quite slow to develop emotionally). It makes me cringe to think about it now and I cringe at all the times I've cried as an adult too. 

I'm not really looking for any advice or anything. I just need somewhere to vent."
MentalHealthUK,12/13/21 04:21:15,"Thinking about admitting myself to hospital, Any advice?"," 

So some background. About 2 years ago, after a long time of putting it off, I finally get a diagnosis of Psychotic Depression. The way my nurse described it is that I had left my depression untreated too long it had manifested itself in hallucinations to keep my brain ""entertained"".

Here's the pinch, the mental health services in my area are nearly non-existent and with the added pressure of covid I have been left without seeing the early intervention team and I am still waiting on an ECG appointment to make sure I'm healthy enough for the antipsychotics.

I am really struggling to hold down a job because the slightest bit of pressure makes me crumble the anxiety aggravates the psychosis, the psychosis leaves me sleepless and depressed and the cycle continues.

So I have just started a new job, one week into training and I have spent the whole weekend sleepless and anxious and tormented. I need to get this sorted and the only way I can see it happening is forcing it by being admitted.

Does anyone have any experience with this and would you recommend it?

MentalHealthUK,12/12/21 16:59:09,the person who was closest to me in the beginning of this year isn’t even in my life anymore,"okay so basically i (19F) had only ever been close to one guy in my entire childhood. i only had 2 friends and one of them was him. we were best friends since 7th grade in school and are now enrolled in same college. but the thing is, he broke up with me in april and my life has been completely upside down since then. the biggest problem was that my life was completely revolving around him and so when he decided to end our relationship, i literally had no purpose. i know how pitiful that sounds. i’ve cried myself to sleep uncountable number of times. i’ve called and yelled at him (and felt guilty later) so many times. i genuinely would have never thought that a break up would affect me so much but IT DID!! it did y’all! around october, it was just too much for me to handle alone so i decided to go to therapy. and it’s december now and i’m trying to get better and i really am in a lil better place now. i just hope i achieve my goals of being independent emotionally and being able to put my own needs above anyone else. i just hope i get over him soon cause i genuinely don’t want his memories to haunt me for life and ruin me. i’m just scared of seeing him when i’ll be leaving for college for offline classes. now i think that enrolling in the same college was the biggest mistake ever! but well, i’ll just have to learn to face him (and possibly not cry everytime i see his face lmaooo). also, ps, i’ve also been off social media since april cause i’m scared i won’t be able to handle it cause he’s very active on social media and i’m afraid i’ll start acting like a maniac and stalk him everytime lol.

anyways, thank you so much to everyone who read this far hehe."
MentalHealthUK,12/12/21 09:30:25,Getting sectioned,"I was arrested and sectioned last year after my mum called the police, and told them a lie. I was 19. To this day I have no idea what she said.

Why were the police allowed to arrest me? And why was I not told that I was being sectioned? 

I also refused to undergo the mental health assessment that was offered to me while in police custody. But I was still diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia even though I answered none of the questions and walked out of the room. 

I was told the doctor diagnosed me based on what my mum had said. Is this the proper way to derive a mental health diagnosis? 

Why is evidence of a mental health disorder not required but hearsay is accepted in deciding on a diagnosis?"
MentalHealthUK,12/12/21 06:16:22,Why is it if you're relatively smart and intelligent that your mental health is more dismissed?,"OK, so I know some people might not agree with me on this, but I have experienced this first-hand and it's actually really dismissive when mental health professionals say this. When they said ""I can tell by looking at you that you're intelligent!"" or ""Wow, you're really smart!"" It's like they're suggesting that because I'm smart or intelligent, that I shouldn't have mental health issues. Or that I shouldn't be struggling because I am smart. It doesn't really make much sense why they say this. It's like I've got to have a learning disability in order to be taken seriously. Or it's like because I'm smart and quite knowledgeable, I should be able to manage my mental health myself. It just makes me feel quite angry and upset because it makes me feel invalidated.

I don t understand what happened."
MentalHealthUK,12/11/21 20:30:51,SYMBIOSIS (Depression parasite film),"Hi everyone.

I always found there was no engaging form of media that adequately showed what its like to live with depression. I'm diagnosed Bipolar type 2 and find the depressive episodes the hardest to contend with. As a director/choreographer i've always wanted to explore this invisible disability and create a tangible product to show those unburdened by depressions effects; in addition to being a cathartic viewing experience for those suffering.

So, I have created this short self funded Horror film - [https://youtu.be/7BRo\_9IYCAw](https://youtu.be/7BRo_9IYCAw)

I hope you all enjoy this and let me know what you think! Hope everyone is doing well and taking care of themselves.

SYMBIOSIS (Synopsis) :

‘SYMBIOSIS’ delves into a parasitic dystopia , anthropomorphic manifestations of depression have overtook society. The parasite is contagious, replicating facets of insect behaviour. Crawling from host to host, swarming their minds with the incessant buzz of negative thought. A period of isolation is required after contracting a parasite to curb the horde. The events of SYMBIOSIS detail an individuals time in isolation, infested with multiple parasites.

Thank you for your time"
MentalHealthUK,12/11/21 12:36:08,I'm very upset with services. Feeling let down.,"I am so sorry if this post may be upsetting to some, I don't want it to be personal. I understand that there are health professionals also on this sub, again I don't mean for this to be directed at them at all. I just need to vent a bit.

Very recently my opinion of mental health services and care services has plummeted. So many people have worked against each other and it's always been me who suffers the consequences. I've been involved in the system for about 10 years now and I seriously want out.

I live in a care home/supported living (I don't know which it is, they change it's description to suit them best. They've betrayed me through a myriad of ways numerous times, a common theme is for it to be a care home one week so they can claim to have the power to be able to do something, I.E: take items away but another week declare it a support home to avoid responsibility for some errors to then shift the blame for something on to me, I.E: despite us having keys we don't have to make sure your  room is locked, you should have had insurance to cover you stolen item), I really don't like it here. I have witnessed abuse and allegations of abuse of various forms (sexual, physical, financial, emotional, systemic - I'm currently compiling all the info I have into a comprehendible format to give to a regulating body. The abuse has ceased after the police were involved but I feel as though CQC should know). I've been scapegoated myself, manipulated and lied to in order to get me away from site when CQC were last present (staff here were aware I wanted to speak with them, they also know that I know a great deal of wrongdoings). I've been goaded by staff before with hopes to get a negative reaction from me to justify some things they have done. I've had false complaints made in my name by staff to get other staff in trouble. I've seen several confidentiality breaches (one of which was the manager telling me personally, another service user why another service user went to hospital, what was wrong and proceeded to make fun of them for it). They've put me under threat of a DOLs, when I tried to hand my notice to leave in they suggested that they'll just apply for a DOLs assessment to keep me here and furthermore proceeded to reject my notice period.

Then there is hospital. I have lost nearly 3 years of my life locked up. I don't have an education because of the NHS. I've spent more time detained than some do after committing serious crimes, I don't even have a criminal record. Whilst in hospital I and other patients were subject to abuse (again, sexual, physical, emotional and psychological). This was the worst. I've been beaten up by HCA's, I even have to go for an MRI at some point now as I was told that supposedly I might have some brain damage from one incident of a HCA knocking me out by hitting my head of the floor during a restraint. They'd again do things like goad patients, tease us and bully us and when we can't take it we get hauled off covered in bruises to sit in seclusion for hours. I once spent a whole week in seclusion with blood still on the wall from where someone else had hit their head on it repeatedly, the light constantly on not allowing me to get sleep eating either soggy or stale sandwiches three times a day, wearing no clothes other than the blues they give you. We were just kids, I once made friends with a young girl, she was particularly young compared to everyone else, we both had an interest in martial arts. I remember once she was bored, like most 12 year olds would be sat on a ward with fuck all to do all day so she pulled the laces open of one of the staff. The dude just got up and shoved her to the ground, when she tried to stand up for herself several other staff picked her up and just put her in seclusion for 6 hours.

I remember being 17 and I actually wanted to work with services. I didn't feel right at all and I said to myself ""fine, okay, let's see what I can actually do to sort myself out"". I begged for help. I was always against going to hospital but I tried my hardest to convince myself that if I could focus hard on getting better then I wouldn't be there long anyway. It wasn't what I expected. I was there for 4 days before they kicked me out, my mother couldn't look after me at the time so I was also left homeless and had to be put into emergency care. I remember the meeting on the last day. The hospital doc, my community doc, one of the hospital nurses, my dad, my mum, my social worker and a teacher from my school. They said I had no mental health problems and in fact had a behavioural problem and refused to help me. I was placed into care, two weeks later I no longer wanted anything to do with them. They left me in the dust and I couldn't stand them. By the end of that two weeks I was sectioned for another 6 months and diagnosed with Bipolar. It was the biggest loaf of wank I've seen. They completely fucked me over.

Had had a bad time and was admitted to hospital for 13 days a few months ago after my nurse wasn't taking my call for months and randomly discharged me. Nobody was listening and I was left up shits creek without a paddle. After the hospital visit they tell me they're so sorry and it won't ever happen again (I was only given an apology this time as other professionals were closely watching and put in a safeguard after they lied to me and abandoned me again). Come to now and guess where I am? Shits creek. What don't I have? A fucking paddle. They made this huge ordeal about having a safety plan. Things like ""staff to phone crisis team during crisis on behalf of xx due to lack of trust"" and ""crisis team to perform gatekeeping assessment at xx's residence"". This turned out to take the record from last time. Not only does nobody seem to follow it but nobody even wants to acknowledge it. No part of it comes underway. It's a complete facade. I went to see the crisis team at A&amp;E a few months ago. I was told they refuse to see me and give any input as I have a care plan in place. They're part of it though... Damn, I really can't do this.

Everytime I try to work with them they seemingly up and vanish. I again can't get ahold of my new nurse. Last I saw her was at a meds review and she told me she was going to send me an email of the things that are going to happen. One being a change in meds amongst others she was going to list in the email. Not only do I not have the email but I have had no meds change and none of the things that was discussed and was agreed to happen have made any noticeable progress. I'm completely in the dark here, alone and feeling like I'm that 17 year old kid again getting dicked by the system.

All the shit that's happened over the years is really getting to me. I really can't take it anymore in reality."

MentalHealthUK,12/11/21 07:25:44,Does anyone else with depression get aches or pains?,"(16M) I’ve found that with my depression comes strange unexplained aches in my muscles (particularly upper torso, and left arm). According to symptom websites this can just be another symptom of depression but I hadn’t heard of it before and I was wondering if anyone else had experienced it/if it was particularly common."
MentalHealthUK,12/11/21 01:55:25,Around end of October I received a mail of cdat team,"It was asking me if I wanted to proceed to keep me waiting for the future therapy and what I wanted from them… 

now is more like one year and half which I still waiting… 
This is nightmare, I’m guessing to having adhd, pure ocd… some point of any level of autism… plus deep level of depression and anxieties."
MentalHealthUK,12/10/21 23:10:53,Which medication got you up in the morning?,"Previously, when taking Prozac (Fluoxetine) years ago I had the effect of it making it easier to wake up. This was a double edged sword though as I think it affected my REM sleep and I would momentarily wake through the night. 
More recently, the same occurred with Atomoxetine, but I stopped it due to no effect on my ADHD. 
So I’m wondering if anyone else has experiences of medications with the same effect?"
MentalHealthUK,12/10/21 20:40:08,Achievement unlocked!,"A few months ago I had a manic episode in which I was hallucinating quite a bit.   When I was in my town’s largest supermarket one day during this episode,  I heard a voice that seemed so very real, but couldn’t have been.   It was saying my name over and over and laughing - cackling - in scary way.    I was petrified.   I am not sure how I got out of there.   I have been too scared to go back there since. 

After the mania passed, I had an awful depression and I ended in an inpatient unit for a few weeks.   It was a great help.  

When I got out of the hospital, I started work on rebuilding my life with the Home Treatment Team and then the Reablement team.     

About three weeks ago, I went to the scary supermarket with my reablement worker by my side, and successfully bought a couple of things.   I stood in the place where I had had the auditory hallucination and felt scared but strong.    It was a real win which my reablement worker supported me to achieve.  

Today I went to the supermarket on my own for the first time since June and I bought everything I needed (except I forgot the damn croissants!)  without freaking out.   Go me! 

It has been a difficult year, but the mental health team around me (and tweaking my meds) has picked me up and got me back to normal.    I am so thankful for all the wonderful NHS and social work staff for being so damn helpful."

MentalHealthUK,12/09/21 11:31:26,Reasonable workplace adjustments for depression/OCD,"I have depression and OCD, and I've been struggling lately. 

It's nowhere near as bad as it has been in the past, but I've been having significant issues sleeping these past few months on top of it which is just leaving me feeling wrecked. I work 13 hour shifts in a hospital lab (7am-8pm), and with how poorly I've been sleeping I usually only get 2-3 hours of sleep a night on the days I'm in work. Today I had to call in sick because I didn't get any sleep at all. 

My managers are aware of my mental health issues and have been fairly supportive. I've been considering asking to work one of the later shifts to try and get some better sleep (a few people work 9am-10pm or 10am-11pm due to familial commitments), but I'm very anxious about bringing it up. I keep telling myself to suck it up, that everyone else can work the early shifts no problem so I should be able to as well, but I really feel like I'm reaching a breaking point now. I just feel so exhausted. 

I guess what I'm wondering is if a change in hours would be considered a reasonable adjustment for my depression/OCD, and if anybody has had any experience asking for something similar? I just have no idea how to broach the subject, or if it's unreasonable to even ask. 

Thanks for any responses!"

MentalHealthUK,12/09/21 02:49:34,"I actually HATE the crisis team, unsure what to do next?","This is a huge rant but I'm sitting on a bus crying and need to get it out. So sorry if wrong place. 

So last week I overdosed, I regret it, I got help and I am fine, at least physically. Its something I'd really like never to do again. Got out Tuesday night. 
While I was there I was also detoxed (alcohol). Just out of my crisis team apt they booked me as a condition of my discharge. 

I was held on a section 5,2 till I could be assessed to see if I was safe to go home, I was and got an appointment to see the crisis team about referrals and where to go from here. I don't really have any support formal or informal. 

I just got out this apt and I am so upset and angry. I'm not getting a referral for anything but put on another wait list that might take months to see a psych about the fact I likely don't have bipolar. They'll also send my GP a letter to resources for prescribing medication (because of an old bipolar dx my GP won't prescribe me anti dependants or meds. I really need a meds change and help, my GP has said they aren't confident in prescribing to me). 

They are saying I should just keep seeing the drug and alcohol team (who seem great but I REALLY need mental health support) and then they suggested I maybe try to find a reduced rate counsellor. 
Apparently I don't need the community team, they suggested my anxiety, panic attack, paranoia and suicide are all alcohol related or manageable. I always come across as okay as I don't show emotion well
. To be fair the drink makes it worse, but my mental health pre dates my drinking by about 16 years, I've been out of services the past 8. I don't know how to get help. I HATE them. I'm so angry I'm shaking and crying at a bus stop.

The night I took the od I told the crisis team lady in the ohone I was going to OD and she hung up, I OD'd called back hysterical and she called an ambukence then hung up without saying good bye. I get they had to call an ambukence but emi don't get why they couldn't have talked to me for a little bit after or called me back. Everytime I talk to them I feel worse and angrier and angrier. I'm not even an angry person, more a sad anxious scared person.

I can't go home or ill drink or hurt myself so going to an AA meeting I've not even booked. I am so angry I'm crying on a bus typing this. So sorry for the ramble but I'm going to explode or something and need to get it out. I wish there was an alternative to the crisis team, or a decent mental health support system in place here."
MentalHealthUK,12/09/21 01:45:47,No sense of danger?,"Hi,

So for reference I’m from the UK (South East) and am a sufferer of BPD, and other co-morbid conditions. 

I’ve had a bad few years with attempts, for example, had two hospital admissions(general) and 3 section 136s. Felt that most of my attempts were minor or not handled appropriately.

Now a year later, I’m at a bad point. At a low which I know can be serious, but because I now don’t really identify danger, I never know when to need help or ask for it? For example, I have had attempts where I have gone missing and had intent to harm myself or if I hurt myself in a physical way, I don’t see it as that serious or bad anymore. I no longer feel much pain from doing anything, and feel a little bit surreal to my environment. 

I haven’t heard from my mental health team in months, my family ignore the issue, I have time off now which is opportunity, but no way of verbalizing I think it’s getting bad again because I can’t identify how? I stopped all medication, and feel like I’m now being blamed for everyone else’s problems. I don’t have a CPN or key worker to contact, feel like I’m doing it alone and the crisis team wouldn’t help unless I’m in crisis - but I don’t even know a crisis anymore! Every day is basically a crisis.

Not sure if anyone has similar experiences or guidance on how to handle this, as I’m scared I’m going to go too far. 

Good luck to you all anyhows. It’s a lonely world out here!"

MentalHealthUK,12/07/21 21:17:39,New universal credit coach is horrible,"Unemployed again due to mh, just had my first call with universal credit since i dont get it anymore. Was supposed to be  in person but i couldn't go due to having to self isolate because i flight back from abroad recently. It was the most invalidating experience.   


First of all she was telling me if i have mh issues i shouldnt have high responsibilities jobs (not like she is wrong but cant she say also that i was strong to do this? Anyway explained that i just lead naturally and genuinely care and enjoy and that the problem is not stress or pressure anyway ) and she was like i just need a sick note for 1 or 2 weeks and ill be fine (bruv)  


 and then when she wanted to give me apmnt when im supposed to be away for xmas and when i said i was supposed to go to france she said ""oooh you see you can do things etc *ffs if you knew how i feel about not looking like i cant work...* "" then she was so mad at me saying like the France is on red list (????) and like im stupid and i should be ashamed for not being informed about apparently today new restrictions (bro its only noon and also i dont find those ?)  


 Anyway i tried to say that i actually dont feel like going so if i cant its fine  but she was so mad still. And then since i have a different in person appointment next week i asked if it was with her or not, when she said no i said i wanted to be in touch with the person before meeting (i was already crying uncontrollably and she was making it worse and i wanted to explain how to not trigger a meltdown via a message on my journal or something) i didnt even manage to finish to explain that that she was like ""i know everything i write everything he will know blabla"" and i was feeling worse and closer to not even being able to speak anymore.  


 I quickly realized that i couldnt get in touch with him and decided i would deal with it and repeated ""ill come ill be fine no problem thank you"" but the woman on the phone kept going like ""you are not  gonna be crying 7/7 24/24"",' today its different"" ""we have  tons of claimants that are ill they have cancer depression etc and they are not asking that *the  absolutely worst, thx i know im a fucking piece of shit*"", ""why you cry? What do you want to say *not letting me explain*"" ""get that 1 week sick note"" ""it was supposed to be 15 min now its 45""   


i just wanted it to end i was actually having a meltdown and she couldnt have handled it worse. At least it was not in person. Im going to write a message on a paper that i will show at my appointment next week  and i hope the guy would be a bit more empathetic because i truly do not want to breakdown at the job center esp in front of ppl who dont understand that i cant control the fuck of it  
Seriously even just on the phone it feels like really awful... I really hate being like this and dont choose and im  not a crybaby   


About the sick note im so fucking dumb that last time i spoke to my usual gp i said i was unemployed but didnt ask for sick note... He is no available in the next 2 weeks but my surgery (bless them) gave me emergency special appnmt but might be with someone who doesn't know me and im already terrified that the same kind of shit than today happen..    


Tldr  my uc coach is horrible and makes me feel guilty more that i am already about suffering from invisible disabilities

I'm probably what some people would say is 'high functioning', in that I manage to hold down a difficult, high pressured job and people think I'm a fun wife and Mum.

I love my Husband and he is a great Dad, but he just can't handle me telling him how bad I really feel, so I've got used to playing it down.  I also had a bad experience with a friend, who didn't realise what I had going on, telling me I'd been a shit friend to her and the rest of the girls, which I've really struggled to get over.

I don't want to burden my friends as I know everyone is really struggling this year, but there's been days that I don't know if I can keep going.  Work is so relentlessly sad and I can't get certain patients out of my head. 

I've nearly dialled the staff health number a few times but I honestly don't know where to start.  I feel so mentaly exhausted after work that it's everything I've got left to act normal for my family until bedtime.  I don't know where I would start to explain how I feel to a 'normal' person.

So just thought I would try in case there was anyone feeling like me and wanting to talk to someone, I'd love to be able to help someone else as well.

I’ve done everything available online to “help” with it but after 12 years its like putting a plaster on a bullet wound.

Over the weekend I referred myself using the NHS site for CBT therapy. Im really new to all this and after looking into it, the waiting time is almost 3 probably more + months to actually speak to someone. I think Im looking to go private as I just cant wait that long, but again I have no idea where to look. Google just keeps bring up bupa for private mental health care. Just need some advice on what to do now."
MentalHealthUK,12/07/21 00:21:47,Sick of being constantly run around and not receiving proper treatment.,"I'm so tired of this same song and dance. For the past year, I've finally got it together enough to seek aid. I was having CBT treatment and the likes and actually had amazing 1 to 1 treatment with a  lovely therapist.  We only had four sessions, and I wish it was more. She let me go because she thought referring me to secondary services would help me more, foolishly I agreed, assuming that finally, I'd get proper support.

Today I just got a letter saying that the secondary services had looked at my information and decided that after an assessment -- something I haven't even been contacted about -- I have been referred back to my GP.

Nothing was done. It took me over eight months to actually get a therapist through the NHS. Months upon months, only to get put right back at square one. 

I just don't understand. What can I do?

I have suicidal tendencies that I'm keeping under wraps, severe depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia that I'm battling, along with my autism. I can't leave the house for long periods of time without someone I know, or my dog -- and even then I struggle. I can't work like this. I can't keep living like this, as I've been in this state for years now.

Why is it so hard to get help? I'm devastated. I thought I'd actually get some help this time around, foolish to get my hopes up."
MentalHealthUK,12/06/21 23:32:25,Where to go for help after seeing GP and doing Talking THerpies CBT course?,"38/M. Finally got to breaking point a couple of years ago now and had a complete meltdown. Was signed off work for 3 months, and referred to talking therapies. That took 5 months on a waiting list to get around to, then i had my 9 CBT sessions. Whilst the therapist was good, and it was nice to just be able to talk and get some stuff off my chest, I really felt like CBT didn't click for me at all and I really didn't get anything out of it. Where can I turn to now? As it is all getting overwhelming again, the stress and depression is really hitting me hard. I can't afford to pay for expensive therapy sessions, it's real tough trying to run a house on one income in this day and age. I don't have enough left over at the end of the month for private therapy. Not only have I already had the free therapy the NHS offers, the only type of therapy they offer is CBT, which doesn't work for me. How can I access affordable help here? I feel like I'm crying out for help and nobody is listening."
MentalHealthUK,12/06/21 18:23:15,Self help resources for people who can't access help?,"Long story but here goes

Diagnosed with BPD at 16. Diagnosed with PTSD at 20, OCD at 24. Also awaiting assessment for autism (3 year wait) and ADHD (assessment in June) (technically already Diagnosed with autism and ADHD but medical records lost so have to go through it again) 

Can't get any help at all. In 2016 and 2017 I entered A&amp;E over 300 times due to various suicide attempts and self harm requiring medical attention. Under SIM scheme due to my BPD diagnosis I was sent home every time without even being physically checked. I now have a chronic kidney condition from repeated overdoses and never being physically checked. I've been called attention seeking, a liar, evil, manipulative and a narcissist by Psychiatrists and mental health nurses in hospital and I now have a massive fear of hospitals. I have to walk past the hospital on my way to work and have a massive panic attack every day. 

Mental health team won't give me any more support. They referred me to community team, who say that because of my BPD there's no treatment and because of my autism they can't offer me anything anyway (no adult support services for autism either). 

I'm not allowed to use the crisis team because they don't speak to people with BPD, and all they tell you to do anyway is go to A&amp;E, who are also told not to treat people with BPD so I just get sent home anyway. The crisis team now have me blacklisted for lying, because ""A&amp;E would never send a suicidal person home"". I'm being sent in circles and it's making me a million times worse. They keep telling me to move back in with my family if I'm struggling, even though I've explained hundreds of times my family emotionally sexually and physically abused me. Then they say ""family would never do that"" and to ""give them another chance"".

I've put in 7 complaints to PALS. All have come back saying there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. Like because I was always made to leave A&amp;E, often dragged our by security before I'd even spoken to someone about what was wrong, there's no evidence I ever went to A&amp;E, let alone over 300 times in 18 months.

I have asked for dbt (there is a dbt service in the CMHT) but they keep telling me there's no such thing as DBT. I asked what the DBT centre was for then, and was told I'd imagined it. They literally have a website but ok. They keep saying there's no treatment for BPD and the NHS is struggling so it's self centered of me to expect anything. 

I haven't slept in years. I have vivid flashbacks in nightmares of child abuse I experienced from my parents, teachers and other kids. They won't offer me anything for PTSD or OCD, because I have BPD and autism. 

I can't cope anymore. I started self harming again. I've been sober for a year and it's getting harder to stay sober, especially when all my housemates drink. They still don't care and keep accusing me of lying about self harm to get support I don't deserve. 
 
My job is triggering my PTSD and I'm struggling to find another job that won't affect my mental health. I'm at risk of losing my job because of my mental health and I'm not qualified to do anything else so I'm struggling to even get an interview (I'm a teacher). I can't afford private therapy. I've tried all the charities like Mind etc here but none of them will take me with my diagnoses. My GP has written multiple letters to the mental health team but they still won't budge. My GP cant do anything else. IAPT won't take me because of the severity of my mental health. 

So how do I get better on my own? I've tried workbooks but they don't really do anything? Like I need a person to guide me through them as I struggle to work out what they're asking me to do. 

If I don't figure something out soon I'm scared of what I'll do. All the people who abused me got away with it. They get to walk around free and live their lives, many have got good careers and families, and I just want some help so I can live MY life. I've had partners beat me up and sexually abuse me with no consequences, all I want is to overcome the trauma and live my life too, but I can't right now as every few seconds I have a flashback to something and have a huge meltdown that often leads to hurting myself. I dont really want to die, not at all, I just feel like I can't live the rest of my life like this and no one will help me. 
 
I struggle with mindfulness and meditation as I can't maintain my focus long enough. I've got multiple apps on my phone that I use daily for meditation and mindfulness but it's not helping.it just makes me feel worse if anything. Mindfulness is difficult with my autism as I know logically what to think, but that doesn't make me believe it? I did loads of CBT and mindfulness years ago, but they always get me repeating affirmations I don't believe, without helping me learn to believe them. 

What can I do on my own?"

I don’t want them to suffer the mental anguish that I have been going through these past 18 months since. The memories started coming back.  

I have been through ‘talking therapies’ and then left in limbo, I’m on countless forms of medications for different prescriptions as well as antidepressants and now I have been referred to the ‘mental health team’ whoever they are because I told my GP that among other things, restricting the amounts of medication prescribed to me each time will not make me any less of a suicide risk, as I can walk into any shop selling fresh fruit &amp; veg to buy certain ones and kill myself far faster than an overdose, as I have an anaphylaxis allergy.

I’m terrible at accepting I need to be off sick and constantly worrying my colleagues will be thinking i’m not ill enough to be off. Be it physical or mental.

I've been considering going up to my University mental health team and ask for help as I feel like i'm approaching a point where I just can't anymore, but does anyone know how useful this actually could be?

MentalHealthUK,12/05/21 20:47:58,Advice about body dysmorphia,"Hello, I’m hoping to achieve some advice and information about body dysmorphia but at the same time vent.

I have a few mental health problems, but today I am writing about body dysmorphia. This is something that affects me every single day of my life. Specifically, my face. 

Essentially, I have a small and extremely asymmetric jawline, to the point where I have zero lower jaw width. It’s like one side of my jaw is just completely missing. Every day, I notice how nobody else I look at around me has this problem. Maybe they have a less defined jawline, but NOBODY I look at has this asymmetry problem I have. 

I am not joking when I say that this is on my mind every day of my life, I’m constantly hyper obsessed with it and always pulling and pushing my skin to see how I’d look with a normal face. Always noticing how others don’t have it. It’s driving me to the point where I don’t want to go on any more.

I have heard about therapy to fix dysmorphia, such as CBT. However, I don’t think that this will fix what I’m feeling. I’m forever stuck like this unless I get surgery. Has this ever been known to happen through the NHS?

Is there any hope, or am I going to forever be stuck obsessing over my disgusting asymmetric jawline every day of my life?"
MentalHealthUK,12/05/21 16:35:11,Our mental health recovery- let's get talking!,"Hi all!

I'd be really interested to hear people's thoughts on the topic of mental health recovery. I must add that this isn't for any research purposes but more out of curiosity to hear and discuss peoples views and experiences. 

    I think it would be great to open up a forum for people to discuss recovery, or whatever they define their experience with mental ill health as, and maybe learn a little from fellow experts by experience.

     I'm currently completing my masters degree at a UK university with a research focus on mental health recovery and I completed my undergrad research in the same field last year. Currrently I am applying to several uni's in the UK to continue my research at PhD level so you might say I'm a bit of a recovery geek. I also have lived experience of bipolar disorder so I've kind of seen, to some extent, both sides of the coin.

MentalHealthUK,12/05/21 06:23:21,Newly diagnosed Mood Disorder - Need dating advice.,"So I’ve a newly diagnosed mood disorder - which of course goes with new medication (I’ve been on them for three weeks). 
I’m doing everything my mental health team says and actively doing all I can to be settled, level, and healthy. I’m having more good days than bad - or at least equal. 
My question: Drinking is obviously not advised. I asked my nurse if I didn’t have the Diazepam PRN (Valium as/when/if I need it) and just take my mood stabiliser and SSRI can I drink. Her answer was it isn’t advised but a glass or two of wine at dinner occasionally is fine. If I feel drunk just don’t take my mood stabiliser and start regular the next day - that’s ok very very occasionally. 


I’ve been asked on a date by a guy I used to work with years ago. For drinks. Now, if the date goes well I’ll want to have one or two drinks then switch to soft drinks. 

How do I style that out? What excuse or reason can I give? 
I am not ready to disclose my mood disorder to him and I don’t want to wear it as a badge that’s a conversation if things get serious.  I’m not ashamed just a private person. 

So yeah - how do I navigate this? It’s all new to me still.

I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and intrusive thoughts about 2 years ago? Dr's wanted me to try self help before medication, tried, didn't work. 

Started on meds about 6 months later, citralopram to start but ended up on max dosage and needing more so was switched to venlaflaxine.  

Have recently started getting through healthy minds but I don't feel like it's doing anything yet. I'm worried for my own safety. 

For a bit of context, I'm married and have 8 kids. I'm in full time work as a chef in a school. My low moods seem to be getting worse. I had a major panic attack yesterday. I've had a couple of small ones before but this was something different and it terrified me. I thought I was gonna pass out at one point. 

My intrusive thoughts don't help. I have daily visions of my family being murdered, my parents and friends dying, finding out my kids aren't mine etc. 

Yes, I've contemplated suicide. I just don't know how to fix myself and I don't know how to get the right help. Talking has helped but dr's just don't want to see me anymore, it's a phone call and a prescription. 

I feel like I'm a burden on everyone, I'm in lost in the pitch black."

Last night I decided to stop taking my medication. I was going to save my medication up so I could overdose. But then 4 hours later, at about 2am, some logical part of my brain over powered that and so i did eventually take my medication.  
But I can't stop crying (the past two weeks ive started crying more and more but today is just next level). I've been sleeping less, I've lost my appetite and my intrusive thoughts are worse. I don't know if this is related to my antidepressants being increased but I can't even do anything about it because my GP isn't open. I have to wait until monday to even try and get an appointment with my GP and who knows if I'll be able to get an appointment then. I don't know if I can even survive until monday.  


  
I just finished talking to SHOUT but I feel like I just made things worse. I hate talking to people when I'm in crisis because I hate myself for it and I just start saying horrid things about myself and feeling more like a waste of space. Also I have a history of acting out on intrusive thoughts immediately after calling the crisis number (which is one of the reasons I wanted to try texting SHOUT instead). He told me to download an app called Better Stop Suicide so I did but I don't know if it'll help.

I understand that i have to keep kicking the can down the road but for me it's a snowball that I'm pushing and with each day it doubles in size.

MentalHealthUK,12/04/21 22:14:55,I'm tired of fighting my mental health and the system,"I have begged for therapy. BEGGED. I've been with CMHT 4 years and either been discharged or told I'm too unstable. I'm sick of countless mood diaries that trigger no sort of help or input. I'm tired of referral after referral only to not fit into the right criteria for any service. I've got a stable finance for another 2 years meaning the I can provide myself the most stable environment for myself and if I dont get help in that time I could loose everything.

I've dealt with all the shitty things CMHT has done and I've screamed and cried over their treatment with me behind doors but kept my lip sealed to them and compliant with *anything* because I'm terrified I'll be deemed un cooperative again, even if I dont think what they're suggesting will be helpful.

They're fine me distracting myself to death, isolating and separating myself from society, not working and having no life. They're fine with me smoking weed to cope every day despite the amount of times I've told them I want to quit and I need help because I've tried before and I cant on my own.

They know nothing about me and they're cool with me being a nobody despite having stressed that I want to work and volunteer and be healthy and have a life.

I'm not sure what this is. I'm so fucking tired. I'm sick of forcing myself to cope for as long as possible and then the inevitable break. I'm done fighting for my life."

MentalHealthUK,12/03/21 19:58:15,I finally feel able to reach out for help but I don't know where to turn.,"This might be a rambling post, so apologies. I feel like there is a lot I need to get off my chest.

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety in silence for a long time now. Since the end of lockdown, combined with a career change, however, things have got progressively worse. The post two weeks I have been crippled with anxiety. Yesterday I had the taste of adrenline in my mouth. I've been feeling suicidal the past few weeks too.

I've never ever talked to anyone about it verbally. Last week I built up the courage to talk to a helpline, which felt like a massive breakthrough for me. Seriously, I'm in awe of everyone who is here who has saught help.

I now feel trapped and stuck though. I built up the courage to contact the GPs'. I had a plan with a written note in case I was too shy to say the words. It's been impossible to get an appointment though. I can only get appointments by phoning at a specific time in the morning, which when it takes me all my energy to get out of bed some mornings seemed impossible. I tried this morning and couldn't get through and missed out. I tried 111 but was met with a 50 minute wait. I didn't have that much time free. I hate that I am a functioning person, I can still get to work even when I am in total internal agony, and my mind is making plans for suicide. I am not very productive like this, but of course that just makes everything worse as the things I need to deal with back up. I don't have the time to sit on the phone for over an hour before somebody notices. I've tried a local NHS crisis line and never got through. IAPT isn't available in my area.

Sorry for the rant.

MentalHealthUK,12/03/21 05:24:57,Can I just be put on medication rather than doing therapy/counselling? Need advice on going to the GP,"So I’m pretty sure I suffer from anxiety as I know I have a lot of the symptoms for it. I think if I look back I’ve always had some form of anxiety, but recently it’s getting worse and worse to the point where it’s affecting my day to day life.

I get anxious mainly in social settings, and again, that’s been getting worse over the past couple of months. It’s not too bad if I go out with someone, but if I’m on my own, my chest feels tight, I start sweating, and I get this paranoid feeling that everyone is watching and judging me. I know these feelings and thoughts are irrational but I can’t help it. When I’m with other people, I constantly have these thoughts that they don’t want me around, or I’m analysing everything that I’ve said. Even today, I went out to a youth group, and although this is a comfortable, non judgemental setting, I got so anxious that I had to walk out half way through and go home. I then end up feeling like crap because I can’t just go out to make friends and socialise like everyone else. It’s getting to the point where I’m only going out if it’s absolutely necessary because it doesn’t seem worth the stress otherwise.

Unfortunately, I’m also experiencing quite a few symptoms of depression too- some linked to the anxiety I’m having but also because of other things. I have periods where things just feel really negative and I don’t see the point in doing anything. The negativity seems to take over everything from having these feelings about myself, my current circumstances or my future. During these periods, I struggle to get out of bed, and when I do, I end up doing practically nothing all day. My problem is that, like the anxiety symptoms I described, these negative feelings have been surfacing more frequently to the point where I’m feeling like that every week for at least a few days.

I know this isn’t normal and I don’t want these feelings to be dictating my life. I have tried CBT in the past for an unrelated issue, but this didn’t seem to work for me and I felt no better after doing it. I’m strongly considering asking to go on medication because I feel I need something to help other than just developing my own coping mechanisms. So can I just go to my GP and ask just to be put on medication rather than doing therapy/counselling? I know I would probably need to be assessed before this could happen. Also, if anyone could give me an insight into going to your GP about mental health issues and what it entails, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks guys"
MentalHealthUK,12/03/21 04:22:24,Advice: First time I’ve really talked or expressed my mental health.,"Hi guys, I normally don’t post on any groups but currently feeling rather lost, and life feels very unfulfilling currently.

MentalHealthUK,12/03/21 04:09:02,"Looking for therapy, willing to pay.","I have sought therapy from NHS but they were unable to provide me with a therapist/counsellor at the moment, I’ve had referral from my GP and have referred myself a few times, have gotten in touch with them many times but all they can offer is CBT which in my scenario won’t be the best for me. I need someone who can help me deal with my past, my trauma, my issues, help me be more self aware, gather more clarity, which in turn I believe will help me a lot to solve the issues in my present. 
I have also sought cheaper therapy options but unfortunately none have been available yet for me in my borough, and I haven’t gotten any appointments yet as I’ve been on the waiting list forever. 

If there is an empath who’s willing to try and help me I would be very grateful. I am willing to pay for the sessions as well and I think that’d make me more comfortable. I prefer someone who can give me time at least once a week over the phone and someone who’s willing to conduct some research on how to help a depressed and disturbed in order to counsel them before they start.

The accommodation where I live now is completely fucked up, overcrowded and with crazy people but at least I have Internet, hot water, kitchen, etc. I have the chance to bid on council flats, but they are all in dodgy parts of the city.

Second I'm really stressed and  triggered right now, took a small od, called the crisis team as I didn't want to take more. They've called an ambulance and repeatedly hung up on me. I just really want to talk to someone, any one have any advice on coping skills? I'm extremely agitated by the threat of forced entry and an ambulance. It hadn't even occurred to me til crisis team said they'd force entry. I can get an uber.

I'd really like any tips on not running, and staying calm. I am assuming it will be several hours till they com that alot of anxiety and I've a bad history with services."
MentalHealthUK,12/02/21 02:15:21,Terrified of starting fluoxetine,"I've had a few mental health issues for a while, and the idea of medication has come up a few times but it's never felt like quite the right time to start. 
Things have got worse recently, and life is generally more stressful so I'm feeling worse and I decided it's time to try medication. I was aware that it can get worse before it gets better, and I was at a point where actually things are just going downhill and it's worth it. I spoke to a lovely doctor who suggested starting fluoxetine. 
I've just come home with the medication, and I'm terrified. I read through the data sheet, and it just sounds horrible. What if I get too tired and I can't drive (I have to drive for my job)? what if I get seratonin syndrome? What if I'm throwing up all the time? Or can't sleep at all? I really need to concentrate at work, and I really struggle to function when my sleep is disturbed to the extent that a lot of people seem to report. What about alcohol, what if I can never drink again? Or feel nauseous all the time? And then have worse effects if I decide to stop?
I realise a lot of this may just be anxious me blowing things out of proportion, but I'm just so scared."

He was standing behind these cardboard stands that contain stock in them so I thought he was looking at it so I didn’t say anything, I couldn’t even see his face. There was no one there at the till so I just stood there waiting for someone to come so I could serve them. When he got to me he said he felt like an idiot waiting there, I said “oh sorry I didn’t see ya there, sorry about that” then he goes on saying I need to be more alert, he starts getting agitated so I say I’m sorry again and then he starts swearing at me so I call a colleague and tell him my colleague will serve him. That wasn’t the end of it, he starts calling me a pussy, saying I’m the biggest pussy that he has met, then he calls me a dick head, I say “look at how you’re talking to me, you should act your age” he responds back with come outside, I say if you want to do anything to me do it in the store (I would get a 5k pay if someone was to hit me so why not do it inside) it escalated he said if he ever sees me outside he’ll fuck me up. my manager didn’t do anything about it. I had a panic attack then I told my manager that I need to leave. 

I’m home now and I just want some advice on how I can find a better job, I have no qualifications.

MentalHealthUK,12/01/21 09:52:52,GP suggested antidepressant to curb my appetite despite telling them I am only eating once a day.,"I spoke to the GP yesterday about long term depression and the conversation lead to discussing my current day-to-day lifestyle and thus eating habits. I told the GP I eat once a day. I have been overweight for quite a long time and over the last few months lost 25lbs. However, this changed my relationship with food, like it did when I previously attempted to lose weight. I am at the point where I will not eat a banana or feel guilty after eating an apple because of the sugar and then let it ruin my entire day. Despite hearing about my weight loss and my eating habits, the GP correlates me being overweight to comfort eating, and suggests an antidepressant that will also make me want to eat less. I felt like I was talking to Katie Hopkins at this point. I have always doubted having an ED but feel like it’s something I might be dealing with. However, I am feeling very invalidated after the GP rules out an ED as I am overweight. I don’t know if I should make a complaint or just take these antidepressants and see how things pan out."

I am have been a very shy individual. I have tried my best to hide my anxiety and depression away from others. My sister has a diagnosis of  schizoeffect disorder and I remember as a young teen standing in a dark dank alleyway to prevent her from escaping out the backdoor of her flat when she need to be in hospital. I decided then to hide my own mental health issues as I did not want this to happen to me.

I have used the intelligence I have to hide my anxiety and depression as much as possible but I am just getting to tired. I tried to get help from my CMHT, GP etc but they are useless. They offer no support. I am just keeping my head above water. Can anyone tell me where I can get help and to see a psychiatrist other than via my GP. 

Thanks"

Last night my mum really shouted me down, listing loads of things I've done that have annoyed or upset. I can't bring myself to go into the details but I do believe some of it was justified and some of it wasn't.
I'm going to try and move out because we're clearly just making each other miserable and I don't want it to be that way but I just find the process of moving out and adjusting to a new routine so overwhelming I've kept putting it off way longer than I should have.

I've been fucking trying but this ontop of this new covid variant shit is nose diving my mental health and I don't think I can handle another lockdown either. I feel worthless and undeserving of any kind of love but I know that offing myself would only make things worse and don't want to do it.

How do I make the intense guilt and thoughts go away?

MentalHealthUK,11/30/21 16:16:07,"A UK Government Petition to ban infant male circumcision - ""Make Male Genital Mutilation (Circumcision) an offence unless medically required""","There is a petition on the official UK government petition website which proposes a ban on infant male circumcision. It should prove more popular with the public than not as **91% of males in the UK are not circumcised.**

**This is a link to the petition:** [https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598185](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598185)

Text of petition reads:

“Make Male Genital Mutilation (Circumcision) an offence unless medically required.

I’m asking the UK Government to criminalise circumcision, no exceptions for Religious circumstances, unless it has to be done for medical reasons, such as an infection. Parents or medical professionals found Circumcising children otherwise should be prosecuted accordingly. More details The fact that FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) is criminalised but MGM isn’t is extremely sexist &amp; wrong.

MGM can have a profound effect on children’s mental health and it is often done without the child’s consent. I am asking that performing or allowing MGM to be performed be made a specific criminal offence. Where a parent is involved the penalties should include losing their child.”

**Why should male infant circumcision be banned?**

1. It is a medically unnecessary alteration to a healthy body
2. The ""health benefits"" are highly contestable, and most respected health organisations have decieded they do not confer enough benefit to justify the operation.
3. Whilst religious freedom deserves to be respected, we do not allow religious freedom to allow parents to make permanent cosmetic alterations to children's bodys in other context e.g. scarification.
4. The foreskin is the most sensitive area of the penis. In circumcision 30-50% of the total penile skin is removed and 50-80% of the total innervation is removed. This greatly reduces the potential of the penis as a sensory organ.
5. Currently women and girls are protected from non-consentual non-medical genital cutting for any reason. This same protection should be extended for boys and men, improving equality of treatment under the law.
6. When a child becomes an adult they may decide that what was done to their body in childhood does not conform to their current identity. This would be true of people who grow up to not hold the same religious or cultural beliefs as their parents, or hold different values.
7. An individual would still be free to be circumcised, but an age that they can give informed consent.
8. Circumcision is easier as an adult and results in better cosmetic outcomes, and less complications.

**Non-consentual circumcision can result in trauma.**

MentalHealthUK,11/30/21 05:54:07,I know that I need to get help right now but I don’t know who to turn to,"  Hi all, before getting into my post, please see bullet points below for background:

· I am a 34 year old male in the UK currently taking Quetiapine (50mg in morning and 200mg at night) and Clomipramine (125mg at night). 

· I am an electrical engineer by profession (with degree + masters), but I have not been able to do my paid job role for approximately 3.5 years now.

· I am currently living with my mother in a fairly quiet area and I am on Employment &amp; Support Allowance (income related in the support group) and also on income protection from my job. My mother doesn’t know what to do with me and I feel like she has given up on me a bit.

· I am managing to do 10 hours volunteering per week split between a local food bank and a charity shop. 

· I am currently under the GP but previous to this I was under the CMHT with a care coordinator. Whilst under the CMHT I had been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD. Due to a bad reaction to sertraline, my care coordinator indicated that I also have bipolar type 2. She also said that based on the way I presented; it was likely that I had high functioning autism and having looked at my medical records, I had a previous diagnosis of anxious avoidant personality disorder (not sure who diagnosed this) but back in my early 20s I had a hospital admission to a psychiatric ward.

· I completed DBT whilst under the CMHT too before being discharged by to my GP. I have no therapist right now and haven’t had one since before Covid.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok now that is out of the way, I am writing this post because I am really struggling right now and I need more help and I don’t know who to turn to. I don’t really feel like a simple case and I only seem to have the GP right now and even then, it all seems to be via telephone due to Covid. 

I am extremely on edge around other people and I am afraid of people including my GP. Having conversations and socialising with people is very difficult as I’m often speaking very quickly (possibly due to being so anxious?) and my eye contact is quite poor. I am avoiding certain areas of my volunteering work space too due to being so socially anxious.

My concentration is really poor and the length of how long I can focus is awful so things like reading a book are out of the question and when trying to watch TV, I often just end up zoned out and staring at the people and not following it. I am really quite restless too so sitting still and settling in to do basic tasks is really quite hard for me. I often move from one thing to another with little accomplished.

I am having days where I am totally in capitated stuck in bed with very little energy. Showering or making a meal is completely out of the question. These days are a complete right off for me; even managing to speak a complete sentence feels overwhelming. Despite these days where I do not eat, I have put on a considerable amount of weight (at least 50lbs) which seemed to happen after going on Quetiapine. 

I know that I need help and it upsets me to say this but I fear that my life is going to end in suicide eventually. I don’t want to die but I just wouldn’t be able to take this for another 30+ years.  What would be the best thing for me to do from this point forward? I would be able to afford private help due to my income protection.

Thanks for any input/help"

So the time gets to the end and the random name generator decided to choose me for the question I was stuck on. I said I wasn’t sure how to do it and sir said why I didn’t ask him for help when I was doing them and got annoyed. He said I shouldn’t be sat doing naf all and that it was unacceptable and put me on a warning.

I told the guy organising it ""oh I might be busy"" and he wanted to know why and I was just vague ""I might have plans that day"" because I don't really feel comfortable saying ""that is the day I first tried killing myself"" out loud. He said that it was in the evening he really wants me to come. Basically we ended the phone call with me saying I'd double check if I was free.

I don't want to go to this because idk how much of an emotional mess I'm going to be that day. I don't want to be in a room full of people I've never met before, discussing hospitals and healthcare on a day when I'm more likely to be remembering those horrible events."

(For background, I've had 3+ courses of CBT, 2+ courses of talking therapy(one that I had to end 2 weeks ago due to a bad therapist) all to not much avail. I'm on my third anti depressant and am loathe to change and go through that all over again. I'm currently in the crux of one of my worst mental health crisis, if not the worst. I recently came to settle on the fact I might have BPD but the horror stories around it mean I do not want to go anywhere near my GP with that statement.

Distraction, mainly. It’s easy to do, but also something with an end result. There’s enough beads and suchlike in them to make a bunch of necklaces, bracelets or whatever, and it’s something you can be proud of making for yourself, as gifts or...well, for anyone. Or just break them down and make more. There’s plenty of elastic.

It’s something very basic, but it’s time consuming, relaxing, easy to do and has a viable end result. 

&amp;nbsp;

___________

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah. Drop me a line if you fancy one, and I’ll sort it. Please let me know if it’s for someone with issues with their fingers / fine motor control, as I can accommodate with larger beads. I can also add in little personalised messages if you want to send one to a friend. 

Be groovy and stay safe

MentalHealthUK,11/28/21 21:07:41,How to stop thoughts of suicide?,Been obsessing over this all day. How can I stop?
MentalHealthUK,11/28/21 17:48:41,4th day on Citalopram and I already want to quit. I hate it.,"I don’t know if it’s normal, but this med kicked me right in the boot.  It’s my 4th day and I feel so stern, I don’t even want to laugh when someone makes a joke.  I feel awful.  My skin hurts and my pupils look as if I dropped a tab of acid.  I can’t eat, I can’t chew my food because I’m so dehydrated even though I drink water. 

The more I read about this pill, the more I want to quit it, so I want to call the practice ASAP and stop.  And my teeth chatter constantly.  I woke up today an hour before going to work SO ABRUPTLY that I was getting anxiety attacks.  I haven’t had an anxiety attack since I was 15, and I’m 22 now.  I’m so awake yet so sleepy…I really want to quit it and get it out of my system."
MentalHealthUK,11/28/21 14:29:32,Need to know how the CMHT process works,"Hi, I was referred recently to the CMHT by my GP. It's not the first time but the last time was a long time ago and I don't remember much about it. I've asked for a full MH assessment because right now my ""diagnosis"" is anxiety and depression which is just... hilariously understating it.

But now what? What happens? I've read through just about every website I can find and nobody describes the process at all. Just ""you'll be assessed and they'll give you treatment"". Like. Look, I need way more detail than that. If anybody feels like being extremely kind and elaborating a lot more, there is no amount of detail that would be too much for me.

e.g.

* When/where do they assess you? Over the phone? In person? How long does a session take? How many sessions does it take for the full assessment?
* Should I bring anything to the assessment?
* How do they assess you when there's no specific disorder in mind? Do they just run through every possible thing?
* What should I prepare to be asked about in the assessment? What should I NOT talk about?
* What happens after the assessment? 
* When does a care coordinator come into this? And what happens / what do you have to do with a care coordinator?
* What kind/s of treatment might be provided? I essentially have complex trauma disorders with a bunch of extra physical shit that is often comorbid. I've been given the usual talking therapy shit before, but to nobody's surprise that hasn't helped. Are they likely to just assign me that again? And again after that?
* How much control do I have over my care? If say they want me to do EMDR, but I know that EMDR destabilises me and isn't appropriate for my situation right now, what happens if I say no?
* Can I request a different psychiatrist/care coordinator/therapist if I don't feel that we understand each other or they're an asshole?
* What can I do to lower the likelihood that I'm brushed off, treated like shit or dropped? e.g. Would it be worth recording sessions to have proof of what was said? Would an advocate be appropriate?
* How serious are they about safeguarding? I live with an emotionally abusive parent and have suspicions that I was sexually abused by the other parent in childhood. If I mention either of those, are they likely to go full nuclear and/or speak to either of them about it?

So, further detail required. I'm sure there's more that happens that I don't know about, and hence haven't asked, so anything you could provide beyond those questions would be amazing."
MentalHealthUK,11/28/21 07:04:45,Talking to someone about dad's alcoholism?,"I'm having a bad time right now, and when my mental health deteriorates everything I usually deal with feels 100x more difficult to deal with. One of those things is my dad's drinking problem. He drinks too much, 70/80 units a week? usually 10-15 units a day. He's a high functioning alcoholic though, he still looks after me and cooks me dinner before he starts drinking. I never need to be his care-giver or anything, but his drinking affects me more emotionally, he becomes very impatient and short tempered when he's drunk and I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around him and sometimes I feel like I'm about to burst into tears whenever I'm around him and he's drunk.

I feel like I need to tell/talk to somebody about it, like my head of year at school. But I don't know what they will do? It will probably be raised as a safeguarding issue right? But, usually if confidentiality ever has to be broken everything is told to my dad, but if it's about my dad then who will they tell? Will they have to tell anyone at all? 

It's probably worth mentioning that I have mentioned this briefly to my therapist before, but she didn't really ask me questions about it or explore it further. She told my dad how his drinking affects me, but he didn't do anything about it or bring it up with me. I've accepted that he probably won't ever change, I can't force him to stop, I've just accepted that I need to deal with it however I can and I feel like right now, to deal with it, I just need to talk. 

Can anybody please give me some ideas about what could happen if I were to tell a teacher/head of year at school? Any comments will be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)"

MentalHealthUK,11/27/21 09:40:33,How do I get myself out of the routine of doing few activities?,"I would say ""how do I stop doing nothing"" because that's what it feels like, but my therapist said not to. I signed up for volunteering at a charity shop, and it's so busy and intense, which made me realise how slow my life is in comparison. I don't know how to catch up mentally.

my typical day is just me surfing the internet and going for a walk around my neighbourhood. I write once a week, shop for groceries, on fridays I play D&amp;D with people on discord (most of the time I dread it, I've wanted to quit for months but I'm forcing myself to have at least some social interaction).  for some people that sounds like an ideal, relaxed life, but it's honestly very boring and depressing and I feel bad for not doing more. 

I don't work, I've been on benefits for nearly 3 years because my mental health hasn't been great and I'm terrified of starting work again because the last time I did: it basically brought out my mental illnesses to their absolute worst. not to mention, I will end up with a shit job due to failing uni, and even my therapist has suggested I'm not ready to study/work again even after all this time. my family desperately asks what my plans are, they're worried, and I don't have a clue.

I've tried going to a few meetup events but I just don't find them interesting. it's stuff like pool nights, karaoke, climbing, life drawing. or they're full of people much older than me and we don't connect. I don't go out to pubs because I don't drink, I don't even go to cafes to have coffee or whatever because I find it pointless and expensive.

I want to not feel so bored, I think having a schedule would make me feel more normal but I don't have much to put on that schedule and I have trouble sticking to it."
MentalHealthUK,11/27/21 08:39:30,Why would the CMHT ask you if you took drugs in your last?,Are there specific reasons why they ask you this question when you're in the Secondary Care services?

Like if you have mental health issues would it mean something if you have those while without taking any drugs in the past as opposed to having issues while having took drugs in the past? Thanks.
MentalHealthUK,11/27/21 00:36:55,Is it possible to switch to NHS prescription/treatment following private diagnosis?,"I was diagnosed as probably having Inattentive type ADHD while living abroad, and I'm trying to get things recognized, diagnosed and to start moving forward with treatment, whether that is medication, talking therapies or anything else. 

I'm in my 30s and it has had an impact on my life without being diagnosed for years! I'm keen to take control of it rather than it having control of me. 

Obviously the NHS is very stretched and there are big waiting times for mental health referrals. 

I'm considering going private for faster diagnosis and perhaps initial trialing of treatment, however I don't want to be tied to private costs for prescriptions or therapy forever after that! 

Is it possible to switch back to NHS for prescription/ treatment from private, or would I have to go through NHS diagnosis and referral again to get anywhere?"

MentalHealthUK,11/26/21 03:51:03,Anybody in UK was able to get a prescription for Bupropion (Zyban) for depression?,"I think I might have a treatment resistant depression. It got really bad recently. I'm spending most of days in bed and crying. Not able to work or to do much. Apathy, zero motivation, anhedonia, fatigue and a horrible brain fog.
I'm also on autistic spectrum (Asperges), and I suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD, the inattentive type.
I have tried in the past these antidepressants:
Fluoxetine
Mirtazapine
Sertraline
Trazodone
Venlafaxine
Duloxetine

I only found venlafaxine helpful in high doses, it felt very stimulating and activating. However, I couldn't cope with the side effects. (really itchy skin rash and other problems)

I've also tried mood stabilizator Lamictal and antipsychotics Aripiprazol and Quetiapine.

I had CBT and DBT but I didn't find it helpful.

I've had a phone consultation with my NHS psychiatrist last week and I asked for Bupropion but I was told it was not licensed in UK for depression. Instead he prescribed me Escitalopram 10mg and Quetiapine 200mg to take daily. 
I tried protesting that ssri's don't seem work for me and Quetiapine is too sedating, even if I take 50-75 mg every night. But he didn't seem to listen, and he was quite dismissive.
I'm not even sure if Bupropion could help but it's norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, so it can offer advantages over other antidepressant drugs...My mood is very low and I'm getting a bit desperate.
Do private psychiatrists prescribe it? And do you have to pay for the prescription and also for the medication? (Not that I can afford it right now anyway.)"

MentalHealthUK,11/26/21 01:59:26,"I saw the psychologists today, I'm not sure how it went...","Hey all,

I saw the clinical psychologist and a trainee psychologist today at my local CMHT. They were talking with me about how they could help me. I said I think I'm depressed. Also that my OCD is well controlled. The clinical psychologist said about how he thinks that I haven't got enough going on in my life, therefore I'm depressed. Also, my obesity isn't the cause of my depression; it's a symptom of it. The main psychologist also said I need things in my life that'll fulfil me. They are going to help me set goals, but I'm not sure if that's what I need.

I was also telling the psychologists about my bizarre thinking and ideas that I get. The main one said that's OCD and how everyone gets thoughts like that, but people without OCD don't worry about these thoughts and ideas. 

I'm not sure if I felt understood properly by them. I did take notes with me but they didn't read them there and then. To be honest, I'm not sure what to do because I told them I do feel beyond help despite being only 22-years old. I did start crying because I was telling them what I am like at home, etc. 

I told him I got a kickstart position within an art gallery as a marketing assistant. This of course doesn't mean I am cured, and they understood that. I'm just worried about how they're going to help me, and if their ""help"" is actually going to help me or not. The impression I got from today's session is that they think I'm down and depressed because there's nothing in my life. 

To be completely honest with you all, I'm not sure what to make of all this! :'("
MentalHealthUK,11/25/21 20:15:20,Soft-blocked from access to therapy. What do I do?,"So for some background I have a history of chronic depression with psychotic features and am under the care of a CMHT.

I have been experiencing a bad phase this year and have attempted to access counselling/therapy through the iapt services, however they will not accept me as I am under the care of a CMHT and they say it is their responsibility as I am under secondary care.

So they kindly wrote to the cmht for me to get me an appointment. Unfortunately the psychiatrist I see and the cmht in general are very lax in their practice and are very much gatekeepers of who gets to access the psychology team, and I have been deemed unsuitable (despite being actively suicidal). As I also work for the trust which operates the mental health services in my county they also seem to think they can be more lax with me as I am a staff member.

So I am unable to access any kind of psychological support as iapt won't take me on both due to the severity of my depression and symptoms and because I am under secondary care, but secondary care won't offer me the help needed.

What would you suggest I do?

Thank you in advance for any suggestions/advice."
MentalHealthUK,11/25/21 18:39:23,New job &amp; current lifestyle making me feel really depressed,"Hi all,

So recently I had to make a pretty big career choice to either go uni to study comp sci or start a new job as an Apprentice in the Cyber field.

After months of anxiety and procrastinating (I have GAD) I reluctantly came to the decision of go for the apprenticeship as everyone was telling me that's the smart option and no student debt as I live in the uk, it stung for a bit as I saw uni as this opportunity to get away from this loneliness that I have been experiencing and try make friends irl. But anyway I went for the job as I felt it was the safer pick and hoped for the best, however it is going really badly this past month and now I am going down this negative spiral which I cannot get out of. I am being demanded to do way too many things, some rather impossible such as this guy telling me to give a presentation to one of our clients about security issues in their organisation of which I know nothing about as I never been told or shown and then when I ask for help he says you should know this and need to stop relying on others. This one guy in particular whos giving me all these stupid tasks, another thing he said is ""you fucking idiot"" on my very first week because I didnt understand something he said, another saying if you dont know this job and how to code by end of 1 month you wont know in a year. It just gets me down tbh.

This coincides with me feeling lonely, no support as basically have nobody, parents dont give a shit and one is narricistic, I am regretting not going uni as I keep thinking at least I would have been happier rn without fully knowing and I am getting some thoughts floating around in my head like ""I dont wanna be here"", i quickly counteract them so I know im not sucidial but I really am losing motivation in life, I am terribly sad, I want to quit but I cant and yh everything is just a mess tbh.

It has made me question do I even want to be in the IT field full stop tbh as I have this big passion in psychology and mental health but I always got told that here in the uk this is a pointless thing to study as you cant get a job at the end. I just feel I am constantly abandoning myself and want to do in order to fit in with society and my family expect me to do. Sorry theres a lot of messaging here but basically I am not happy in my new job, I feel depressed but I have no hope for the future as whilst I dont mind working in IT more generally as its good money on a deep level in my heart I feel I will never be truly happy but I feel theres nothing I can do about it :/"

However, I think I might have made a huge gdpr related mistake. I don't know if I did for sure because I'm not in the office til Monday and the anxiety spiral is so out of control. I keep trying to walk myself through the afternoon but can't remember doing the important bits and the more I think about it the worse its getting.

I would want to get antidepressants that also help with feeling anxious, but i’m wondering A. is asking enough? ive almost definitely been depressed for a looonnng time. i have mild suicidal ideation. and B, will a family history of bipolar and the fact that i experience recurring depressive episodes (months-years) put them off from medicating me without further evaluation?"

Not the steps in between.

That's just one trivial example, but it keeps happening, I feel like things are getting blocked out. Another example is today; I was in the shower washing, next thing I remember I'm out and getting dressed.

I'm not too worried about it, more interested in the reason behind it &amp; wondered if anyone experiences similar? I do have issues with working memory, could it be related? 

**TLDR: I keep zoning out, and not remembering things in between events. Basically feel like I'm on autopilot**"
MentalHealthUK,11/24/21 22:42:05,Feeling suicidal again. Venting!!,"Hi.

I'm not sure exactly what I want to write, but I feel like I need to write or reach out to somebody?

I'm 16, in year 12. I feel myself beginning to spiral down into a dark place again. Usually, this happens around this time of year - although I love the winter weather, my mental health doesn't seem to. I also hate the build up to Christmas, all my friends talk about it constantly about how they're so excited, but for me, it's just an excuse for my alcoholic dad to drink more than he usually does, leaving me alone in the living room on Christmas day whilst he is drunk and asleep upstairs by 3pm. 

I don't really feel depressed at the moment, which is different to previous times where I've felt myself falling down into this place. For the majority of my teen and adolescent years I have experienced intense chronic pain in my leg, which always flares up when my mood is low. But this time, my leg is rarely painful and I suppose that is a good thing, but it makes me feel out of place a little. Like my current mood doesn't feel 'complete' or 'valid' now that my chronic pain isn't as intense as it has been for years. 

I saw a train crossing a bridge on my way to school this morning, and it made me feel weird. I can't work out if it was a good or bad emotion but it felt like something loosened in my chest. Previously, when I have felt more actively suicidal, to commit suicide by throwing myself in front of a train was always the idea I imagined I would go with. I would always think of myself taking my life in that way. 

I feel upset that I have not yet hit rock bottom. I think right now I'm not actively suicidal, I just don't have any desire to exist or move forward, nothing to look forward to, nothing to make me want to keep going. I want to die, but I don't feel like I have a desire to do anything to take my life at this moment, but that frustrates me. Writing it out makes me feel stupid because who would feel frustrated that they don't have the courage to take their life? 

My teachers were provided with my safety plan after I spoke to my head of year at the beginning of the week regarding my mood. I was very brief and vague. But, I thought that maybe, once they had realised I was having a bad time, they would care? And I don't mean to sound selfish or arrogant, but I suppose I wish they cared? Or at least, showed me that they cared. To go through all of my lessons knowing that my teachers knew I was really struggling and for them not to ask me how I was doing or even make an effort to sort of smile at me or something? I just felt disappointed. I've never been somebody who seeks attention, I'm incredibly introverted and hate being the centre of attention but I've found myself feeling a desire for somebody to just pay attention to me? And to realise I'm having a bad time and sit down with me to genuinely ask me how I'm doing. But feeling this way makes me feel guilty? I feel like I'm becoming an attention seeker and who likes people who are attention seekers? I think I'm also partly scared, before, a driving factor for me feeling more suicidal was the thought that ""nobody cares"". And when I sort of prove to myself that nobody cares, I feel like I'm just repeating previous times I've felt low, and those previous times have never resulted in me committing suicide so I feel like I'm back on the same, previous path which is going to end up nowhere when I think deep down I want it to end with me having the courage to go through with my suicide? I have no idea if that made sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm predicted 3 A\*s for my a levels. Which I feel like is putting pressure on me, I don't even want to think about university because I don't want to admit that I might be here for that long. I feel like I need to pin myself up to this impression teachers and others have of me, and I need to show that I am worthy of producing those sorts of grades but at the same time I just don't want to have to care about trying or doing well because as I said, I don't want to admit that I'll be here for that long.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad drinks too much, and has for as long as I can remember. I have made a separate reddit post about this if you care to read any more. I want to talk about it with somebody because recently it's been bothering me more than usual. If I told someone at school, what do you think they would do?

&amp;#x200B;

MentalHealthUK,11/24/21 19:29:51,Changing From The Inside Out,"There’s little we can control in the world. Other people, the stock market, weather, or the world events outside of our influence. However, we can control ourselves, and that’s all we need to control. Changing our inner world leads to the changes we wish to see in our lives

It may be hard to believe that changing our thoughts or attitude can make us healthy, wealthy, and wise. However, making inner changes can have dramatic effects on every part of our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Enhance your life by making these internal changes:

**How you view failure.** Do you view failure as an embarrassment? Is it something you should avoid at all costs? 

●	What if you viewed failure as simply a step along the way to success? Failure just means that the approach you used didn’t work. It’s an opportunity to re-think your process and try again. If you keep learning and making improvements, how can you possibly fail in the long-term?

●	The way you view adversity plays a big part in your overall wellbeing. How do you view setbacks? – are they personal, permanent and pervasive or temporary situations to be built upon?  What view would be most useful to you?

&amp;#x200B;

**Values.** Suppose someone valued charity, kindness, and modesty. What type of life would they lead? Suppose someone else valued freedom, adventure, and courage. Now, suppose a third person valued money, power, and greed. It’s easy to see how these three people would lead very different lives.

●	What are your values? Do they support the life you want to live? Or, is your life in line with your values?

Beliefs. Beliefs frame how you view the world. What you believe about yourself may be limiting. Beliefs evolve through time: do you believe the same about Santa Claus now as you did when you were six years old? 

●	List some of your beliefs about the world, yourself, and life in general. How are those beliefs helping or hurting you? What beliefs would be helpful for you to develop and enjoy the life you desire?

&amp;#x200B;

**Attitude.** Do you expect things to work out for you, or are you primarily pessimistic? You’ll be less likely to try to do something if you have negative expectations. A positive attitude can help with your patience and ability to persevere when things aren’t going well.

●	Consider how your attitude is impacting the results you’re generating in your life.

Gratitude. Giving yourself a reminder of what is already working in your life can positively impact your attitude and expectations. It can also reduce anxiety and benefit your perspective.

●	Take a few minutes from time to time to list the things that make you’re grateful for. Notice the small things – they’re often, actually, the big things!

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts.** Our thoughts are under our control, though it might not seem that way. It’s easy to prove this to yourself. You can choose to think about an ice cream cone or a green cow. You can choose to think about anything you like.

●	It’s valuable to take control of your thoughts. If you’re predominately thinking about negative outcomes, you’re going to struggle.

●	Monitor your thinking, keep things in perspective. Note those recurring, unhelpful, thoughts: challenge yourself to challenge yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Changing yourself internally can support you in living your best life. Without making those inner changes, any behavioural changes are likely to be superficial. You’ll be constantly fighting yourself – and that’s hard work!

&amp;#x200B;

**Inner changes align your thoughts with your behaviour: you with the world around you.**"
MentalHealthUK,11/24/21 15:03:27,Parents with Anxiety - three things you should know," 

Last week our team at the [Parenting with Anxiety](https://www.parentingwithanxiety.org.uk/) team spoke to a group of parents and it got us thinking about what we would like every anxious parent to know.

There is so much information and advice out there but we thought the following things were important.

1. **If you have anxiety it does not guarantee your child will too.**
2. **You have real skills and expertise.** If you are worried about your child's anxiety there are things you can do to support them. While your child is not going to experience things in exactly the same way - you do have insight into what is going on for them. Some of the things that help you may help them too.
3. **Don't be afraid of leaning on the support of others.** Parenting is tough and anxiety can make it hard at times. There is no shame in getting friends and family to add to the care you give your child.

If you are a parent who experiences anxiety you can join us in testing a free online course developed by psychologists at the University of Sussex.

MentalHealthUK,11/24/21 05:43:40,Breakdowns and Drug Abuse,"This one is tough to write. A dear friend of mine has been going in and out of manic states the entire year - they have been in and out of work, on lots of different medications, have had crisis teams over to see them and was recently briefly sectioned. I've been helping where I can, but their partner has taken the bulk of the strain. 

I found out this evening that the partner has been procuring and doing cocaine with them. Possibly just recently, possibly throughout the entire time. I know that the very first breakdown in mid June was definitely caused by an addictive spiral and too much coke - so to find out that both of them are still doing it despite everything, despite the sectioning, despite the state of their mental health has shocked me to the core and I'm not quite sure where to go or what to do. 

Firstly I feel deeply betrayed, which I recognise is irrational, but it makes it hard to want to have a constructive dialogue. This is clearly addiction in the bleakest form I've ever witnessed but I have no idea where to start with it - it's gone from being a nebulous mental health crisis to something I have even less of a framework for. Does anyone have experience of this? Do I leap straight into a crisis line for advice or try to talk to them directly? We have a support network but they seem to feel just as in the woods as I am. What a year this is."

MentalHealthUK,11/24/21 00:35:07,TW (asking for support and advice concerning sh + si),"I don’t know what to do. 

I’m accessing long term therapy through a non-NHS arrangement, and it’s incredibly helpful but not sufficient support for me right now. 

My self harm and suicidality keeps escalating, and I’ve overdosed on multiple occasions in the last week.

I recently self discharged from the crisis team because they were making things worse, but there seems to be no other help available? 

I’m waiting on (yet another) CMHT referral but am worried I’ll end up dead before that at this rate. 

I’ve completely lost trust in NHS services and don’t feel safe going to A&amp;E or reaching out to a crisis number. I’m scared I’m going to end up doing myself worse liver damage because of not seeking support after overdoses. 

I don’t know what I’m hoping to hear to be honest, I’m just lost and scared and don’t feel safe anymore - especially not around those who are supposed to “help”. 

Stay safe everyone x"
MentalHealthUK,11/23/21 23:57:35,Are these red flags or am I being a bit paranoid? (Therapy),"I can't get any help through the mental health services due to SIM and a BPD diagnosis. They will not help me even when I'm actively trying to end my life. I've put in multiple complaints and they don't get anywhere. 

So I found a woman who is a qualified trauma therapist. She offers some free long term therapy for trauma survivors. She's nice and understanding but there are a few things that have been making me a feel  a bit off 

- always talking about other clients. We spend a good 20 minutes per session with her telling me about her other clients. Asking me what medication she thinks the person needs, saying she doesn't agree with their diagnosis and asking me what I think they might have because I ""seem very knowledgeable "" (no background in mental health, I'm not trained in mental health or have any qualifications in it, my career is completely unrelated to mental health). I mentioned ages ago having tried Quetiapine but it didn't work for me. She found out one of her other clients was taking it and asked me if she should tell them to stop taking it, because it didn't help me. I just said I didn't feel qualified to answer that and that meds have different effects on different people. She said this person was diagnosed with schizophrenia but she disagreed as she said he seemed more like he had PTSD and DID, and asked if I would agree with her so she could tell him that the psychiatrist was wrong. She said she thinks the care home he lives in is intentionally misdiagnosing him with schizophrenia so he has to stay there and continue to pay them, that they just want money, they don't want to be honest with him. 

- we don't do anything. When I've had therapy in the past we've done ""activities"", even if it's just a worksheet or something. But this is just me venting and she says the same thing ""well its a shock you've made it this far with all that trauma!"" No suggestions or coping strategies even when I ask she just keeps saying it's a shock I've managed to get here. 

- talking about her own trauma. She trained as a trauma therapist due to her own experience with childhood abuse, but she has told me specific details of things that people did to her and its kinda triggering. I know I'm talking about my trauma, but it almost feels dismissive when she responds with her own stories.

I'm not really getting anything from it but if I leave I fear I'll never get anything else since the mental health team have made it very clear they will not support me and I just feel a bit stuck. I've had awful experiences with therapists in the past so I'm not sure if I'm overthinking and reading too much into it. I'm grateful she let's me go for free and there's no time limit on it, so I worry I'm making a big deal out of someone offering me free, indefinite therapy and I'm just beig a bit selfish"
MentalHealthUK,11/23/21 22:46:17,CMHT being shite and not communicating with GP,"Last month the psych at my CMHT phoned me and said that I should double the dose of my antidepressant. So I asked him if he was going to send me a new prescription and he said it wasn't necessary, just double the dose and then I'll send a letter to the GP so that they can update the prescription.

I have been calling the CMHT and an extremely rude secretary tells me everytime that the letter will be sent and other sarcastic comments such as ""We are not stupid here, you know!""

So I'll have an appointment with my GP next Monday and if they don't know that the dose should be updated I'll be short of pills. So, apart from pestering the CMHT, what can I do?"

When I was 14 I had a operation on my disability, during which I was abandoned by all my childhood friends. 

So for years I sat and suffered alone, but then slowly I started getting my shit together giving up addictions, losing alot of weight and working on my mental health but still never had any friends until about 4 months ago, I finally got a group of mates I thought but after a incident at weekend I felt abandoned by them again &amp; I feel like I no longer trust or belong with them. They are offering for me to go back in to their group but I feel like I'm being blamed for what happend so they don't feel bad.

MentalHealthUK,11/23/21 06:33:09,"Currently having a panic attack, because I may have breast cancer and cannot reach my GP, HELP??","I got the Covid vaccine first dose in June.

Two days later I experience a symptom I never had before with any other vaccine: swollen lymph nodes in the armpit.

I spoke to the the doctor who did my second dose, he said it’s common occurrence with Pfizer’s vaccine and it would go away in several weeks. This was also confirmed with scientific articles and by speaking to a European friend of mine whose also a doctor.

Now four months later, the lymph nodes and sometimes the sweat glands under both armpits become swollen on an on/off basis. Every few weeks or so and are quite painful. If I take anti-inflammatory for migraines or the flu, they go away and come back after a bit.

This is extremely worrying for me and anxiety inducing. As such symptoms have often meant breast cancer or lymphoma and I'd like to avoid a late diagnosis if it was to be so. I am only 26 and on my own in this country, I don't know what else to do to get help!

So far over tried contacting my GP in various ways but they claim to be too busy and no appointments are available until 2022.

Also, I've been calling every morning before 8 for the past two weeks and there's never any spaces. Even more times during daytime.

Then, I tried to register with another practice, but all of the ones close to me are full and not taking new applications.

I've also tried to contact private clinics, but without any GP recommendation I've been told they won't be able to assist.

Currently, I am quite desperate and in pain. So much I have considered using my EU passport to go to France and get checked there, however, as it would only work for emergency.

My question is, should I call 101?

I know the NHS is currently struggling and I got told off by them for calling in a UTI soon-to-be kidney infection. But I really don't know what else to do.

I don’t know if this is the norm but I’ve been told I have emerging bipolar, I had a “one stop” assessment with a psychiatrist practitioner who said she needed a second opinion from an actual psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis on the type. Apparently the psychiatrist is on sick leave and only works ones day a week and hopefully I’ll be seen in a couple of months. (I was informed this via text when I was told I would receive a letter lol). 

My GP won’t prescribe antidepressants because it will make me worse, I can’t be prescribed anything else until I’ve seen the psychiatrist. I don’t know what to do. I’ve had a really bad day, I can’t relax I’m so agitated, sobbing uncontrollably. I feel scared, usually it passes quite quickly but not today. So I called the crisis team and asked them what I should do and she said to call my GP tomorrow and have a hot bath in the meantime. 

My GP has already said she can’t help me further. I feel defeated at this point, I just want to calm down. I’ve had a really bad few months and I don’t know if I can wait any longer.

Is this the normal process? Are we just expected to wait it out?

MentalHealthUK,11/23/21 01:26:51,How to get out of a bad cycle of bad mental health leading to bad physical health and so on?,"tw/ drug use.


I feel trapped in a cycle. I'll feel bad mentally, maybe too anxious to go outside or just overwhelmed. Then I'll do what will make me feel better, get a takeaway, or see friends and get drunk, or just smoke weed. 


I know I need better coping mechanisms but this is usually once I've exhausted better ones.


I think due to being unhealthy, this has made me pretty physically unwell as well. I'm prone to throwing up and there isn't a day I don't feel nauseous. I had a blood test and all was normal though. A lot of my pain is psychosomatic, I'll suddenly be in lots of pain before doing certain things. 


Problem is, I can't seem to get out of it. I'm positive I will feel better mentally if I sort out my physical health and vise versa. I'll try and try again to be healthy and use planning and small goals, like have at least 1 good meal that's not a takeaway every day,  or try cutting down my weed usage. 
But it always fails no matter how well I planned it even when I had a therapist or crisis team help. 


For example last week I went out for a nice walk with my boyfriend and it was actually enjoyable. But then at some point I started feeling really sick and had to resort to throwing up outside in a city centre. Obviously this wasn't pleasant and I've only been outside once since because I'm anxious about it happening again and also still in pain.


I've talked to my doctor but they just chalk it up to anxiety and being unhealthy. Which I agree with, I think being unhealthy makes me more susceptible to feeling more sick when I'm anxious. It aggravates it. I'm just really stuck in a loop it seems.


I wondered if anyone had any advice? I'm so done getting knocked down by everything."

MentalHealthUK,11/22/21 23:31:03,Sertraline side effects,"Hello redditors. I was started on Sertraline 50mg 5 weeks ago. In the first 2 weeks I didn’t notice anything (no improvement or deterioration) but in the last 3 weeks I’ve had some weird symptoms/ side effects? I’ve started feeling very dizzy, especially when I’m anxious. I also can’t focus on anything because of brain fog. In addition, I now get chest pain when I’m anxious, which I didn’t get before. 

I’m concerned because a lot of people who are on Sertraline have said that the side effects went away after the 2nd week for them, so the fact that mine are coming on much later, and lasting longer, worries me. 

I just wanna know, will these side effects go away after some time, or will they always be there? 

I kinda blame myself for this because I was originally on citalopram 40mg but asked the GP to switch me to Sertraline because I’d heard it was better for anxiety, and because citalopram wasn’t doing enough to help my anxiety and sleep. If it turns out sertraline is even worse for me than citalopram, then I would’ve suffered all these weeks for nothing. 

In the time I’ve been on sertraline, my anxiety and sleep hasn’t improved at all and has actually gotten worse, especially my social anxiety. 

I spoke to my GP again recently. She knows the whole story (how I was on citalopram initially, then switched to Sertraline). I asked her does she think these symptoms are side effects of sertraline or if it’s my anxiety itself not responding to sertraline (and hence getting worse), she said it’s hard to tell. 

But because I’m now established on sertraline, she said it’s best I stay on it for now, rather than having to taper me down and switch back to citalopram, which she said would make me feel even worse. She increased my dose to 100mg, which I haven’t started yet.

GP appointments are only 10 minutes, so admittedly I didn’t go into as much detail as I’m going into in this post, because we didn’t have time. I just said to my GP that since I’ve been on sertraline, I’ve experienced new symptoms (severe dizziness, chest pain) and my old symptoms have gotten worse (anxiety, sleep). I just hope I gave her enough information to make the correct decision 

Obviously I trust her judgement but I just wanna know if the side effects of dizziness, brain fog, chest pain and worsening anxiety will go away. Especially as I’m going up to a higher dose now, I’m worried they will get worse. I also wanna know if you think sertraline is gonna end up working in the long term or if I will have to switch back to citalopram, because that will be a big blow for me, knowing I’ve failed on 2 antidepressants"

TW for suicide and cutting in case anyone needs it

I am not considering suicide at the moment nor to I have any plans or means to. i’m not at risk.


Hello. I’ve been struggling with sucidal thoughts and tendencies and bad mental health for a long time. It’s starting to scare me, because i can be somewhat fine for a second then I get a huge “i want to kill myself urge” minutes later.Like 2 days ago I just wanted to take a walk then the feelings started to creep up again then I considered walking into my local river, then when I get home I considered jumping out my bedroom window.It’s like that.

It’s starting to scare me and I don’t know what to do. It’s not normal to have breakdowns and wanna commit suicide almost daily. I don’t know how to get help because I just turned 18 recently i’m still new to being an adult so I’m not sure how to go about it. My mental health is horrible I cut myself when I get really stressed, sometimes I take too much of a specific medication (not like a specific prescription just like paracetamol or something) as a means of almost internal self harm or in hopes that i’ll overdose. 

In my culture (not british culture i’m an immigrant) getting mental help is frowned upon and I was talking about this to my mum today actually and she said that she doesn’t doctors to label me as “mad” or that i have “psychiatric problems” in her words and i need to deal with this through other means like getting a hobby or going out with friends. but i can’t do stuff like that anymore it’s getting too intense. it affects my schoolwork, i won’t study because i don’t see the future or i feel like i’ll kill myself soon. I spend money impulsively with a “doesn’t matter i’ll be dead soon” mindest and I consider/try to commit suicide often. It used to not be that often but now it’s literally weekly, I’m scared. I want to get help for myself and for others too to be honest I don’t want these feelings to potentially made me a toxic or bad person I want to be a good person. 

How would I go about telling a doctor about what I’m feeling and what would they do? Would I be admitted to a psych ward or put on medication or something? Also would they tell my parents? I assumed not because i’m 18 but i’m wondering if they would if I expressed suicidal ideation."

MentalHealthUK,11/21/21 02:44:05,What can I do for a psychotic man who won’t go to the DR?,"This has been 4 years, we’ve had police, we had a telephone with chief the next day, rang the mental health team which he isn’t referred so won’t come out and look at him and his DR is adding to the issue, because he might be experiencing psychosis but he plays the game to not get that label. We even considered sectioning but told we don’t have grounds…

Give me strength like. I do have talk therapy but apart from coping with the situation which I realised is gonna have to happen after the 4th time he has packed his bags and left, he returns as his mate after 5 days will kick him out. So he just strolls in again. 


Said person thinks people are trying kill him and sits on that god awful site bittube believing 200 view video over anything real. 

This guy is very smart, did science and maths degrees but psychosis is obviously a very off way of thinking. 


Here’s just a few clues, 


1. Doesn’t know how to dress anymore (this is weird as it just looks like he put anything on or goes all one colour)


2. Derails every conversation to take about conspiracy or say “controlled opposition”


3. Religious delusions - changes all the time. One day he might be reading the bible all day and up for building a temple, the next there is 2 Jesus. Atm there is nothing but energy, okay whatever but it’s not an every day conversation 


4.  Told me an orange and a squeezed orange are different. Ones an acid and ones an alkaline. I offered to prove him wrong with a £1 test kit but no, then the argument gets derailed by something else. You can’t win. 


5. Worst one, anyone who comes to our house, even a postman will be his time to educate the end of the world, I’ve learnt to zone the conversation out, the confusion on the persons face though is kinda a pay off. 

Obviously doesn’t believe in covid
Thinks the jab kills you
Also thinks if you don’t get a jab they are building slaughterhouses for them. 


You get the drift, just writing this gives me a banging headache never mind the fact he was shouting and pointing at me half an hour ago. 


His DRs know through letters said
“You don’t have to live with him” what and let my dad wonder the streets?


The police were called once which is when we thought the nightmare might change as our doctors pointed us in that direction. So one day when he was being aggressive I called, they said it’s not your fault but we are now social workers, this is what we get called to most yet have no powers to sort it out. 


I wrote a letter asking his GP why he gave a man like this Zoloft 100mg, why he hasn’t done the protocol of reviews either which he dodged the question (Zoloft didn’t create, it’s not mania or manic), I got no actual answer other than tell said person I’d like to see him….yeah thanks.

MentalHealthUK,11/20/21 06:29:08,TW: How do I access support when services keep passing me around?,"TW: suicide/self-harm

As the title says... it's been a pretty shitty few weeks...

I'll try and keep this brief. In short, I took myself to A&amp;E a few weeks ago after a suicide attempt and was assessed by a mental health practitioner. I was discharged on the condition that the crisis team came to visit me the next day and that they would have regular contact with me whilst my medication stabilised. The next day, the crisis team called to arrange an appointment then rang me back an hour later to cancel and referred me back to my GP - because I wasn't actively suicidal at the point they rang me. They also said they would refer me for Talking Therapies despite me telling them I've already tried CBT 3/4 times prior and it doesn't work for me.

So, following suicide attempt, it then took five days for anyone to contact me (GP) who can only really offer me support through medication. My GP is really good but her hands are tied but she has been calling me to check in weekly. 

I've still been struggling with suicidal thoughts and self-harm but haven't called the crisis team as they abandoned me so figured they wouldn't help but I eventually called them a few nights ago. I spoke to someone and when I explained how I was feeling he told me to watch a film and speak to my GP... so I will not be calling them again.

Spoke to my GP again yesterday who said she was going to ask for a mental health practitioner to call me today. Had the phone call this afternoon and she said ""if the crisis team have discharged you there is nothing more I can do"" and that if I feel unsafe then I need to go back to A&amp;E... to start this whole rodeo again. 

My employer has been really supportive and they have referred me for counselling through the employee assistance programme and I finally received a phone call today for an assessment for it.... and, of course, they cannot offer me counselling through their service because I am ""too depressed"".

So, I cannot get counselling from work because I'm too depressed...  I cannot get support from the crisis team because I am not depressed enough... I honestly don't know what else to do or what to ask for or what. I need something and I am genuinely worried that if I don't get something then I am going to be one of those cases that people will read about and see all the missed opportunities once I'm gone..."

i’m a 16 year old student, currently studying my last year of gcses. i currently attend a hospital school, which i was referred to last school year. after briefly re-joining mainstream school in july 2021, i was deemed too unfit to stay and was kicked out and sent back to the hospital school. 

obviously i hated being alive when i was still a student at a mainstream school. it was clear i had my issues and there was no hiding that fact. i’d regularly self harm in school (and at home), punching walls in fits of rage became quite a frequent thing for me and i was actively suicidal. i’m not stupid, i’m aware why i was kicked out of my school and completely understand why i was deemed unsafe to be in that environment. 

but the thing is, after all of those things i’ve said, i spent some of the best days of my life in my mainstream friends. i had an excellent support system of teachers, friends and other members of staff and always had someone who was there for me when i needed it. even with all the hard times school was one of the only things i was really living for, i honestly loved it there. 

the opposite can be said about my hospital school. i have no friends, there are no members of staff who i feel comfortable talking to and i hate it there. i have almost daily panic attacks regarding school, i’m the loneliest i have ever felt in my life and i literally no longer have any reason to keep living. 

i’m still suicidal, i still self harm and punch walls and scream at people on school, all the things which caused me to be kicked out of my mainstream school are still prevalent, even more so now. in fact, i’m honestly willing to say that most of my problems are a lot worse. 

i have no chance of going back to mainstream school, no one in my hospital school likes me and that’s not going to change, it was the same last time i was here. 

what’s the point in carrying on, in a life i fucking hate?"

A close extended family member had a suicide attempt. 

I want to support my partner and have been wondering if a book would help. 

I have read Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig and that was my first idea.

Does anyone recommend any books for a person to read if their immediate family member has attempted suicide?

To add - this happened a couple months ago and the person is recovering and has support from family and professionals. My query here is to support the immediate family member."
MentalHealthUK,11/19/21 06:55:35,"If I SH my bf will break up with me, if not he will propose","TL;Dr Basically what the title says. 

I (25f) have suffered from depression for 7 years (still waiting for psychological treatment ) 

I self harm very rarely but when I do it usually ends in a trip to the emergency room. 

About 2 weeks after the last time where I attempted to cut my femoral artery and missed, my bf (31m) said he would break up with me if I self harmed again. Any cut, burn or scratch would be the end. But if  I didn't he wants to propose. 

I don't know how to feel about this. I know he has to have boundaries of what he can deal with but I don't want a stipulation added to a proposal.

Please help me know what to thunk and if thus is fair."

But I’m feeling so guilty about taking time off work. This is the second time I’ve had time off work because of mental health this year. Long term sickness. I feel so awful for letting them down and for not being better and not being the person they hired.

MentalHealthUK,11/19/21 01:54:09,I'm sliding into bad mental health.

I'm becoming depressed and don't recognize myself a lot of the time recently. It's getting worse. I've got a cbt therapist but it isn't really helping much. Is there any way to get more provisions of support before I get worse?
MentalHealthUK,11/19/21 01:11:55,Does having a job = you're mentally fine and you don't need help?,"So, I managed to get myself a 6-month placement from the government's Kickstart Scheme programme. I've got an assessment next week with the psychologists, however, I don't want them thinking I'm suddenly cured and I'm OK just because I've got a job that's suited to me. It's only for 6-months and then it could lead to a permanent job at the end. However, I don't want people thinking I'm cured just because I got this job. Do you know what I mean? 

Working would be a distraction for me at this point and working or doing volunteering would (I believe) really help me. But I'm thinking because they think it's paid work, that I'm mentally and emotionally capable of managing my mental health and don't need the help. 

Maybe I'm overthinking this, but I worry a lot."
MentalHealthUK,11/19/21 00:17:49,Self-Esteem of Self-Worth?,"**Self-Esteem**: is about the actions we take in the outside world, how we portray ourselves and how we compare ourselves to others (invariably negatively), how we think others perceive us. It is externally focused.

**Self-Worth**: by contrast is internally focused. It is the value we place on ourselves. It comes from living authentically, living the life that is right for us – consistent with our identity, values and beliefs – all those things that are inside us: living out own lives and being our best selves.

Without self-worth, we will never have self-esteem. Once we know our authentic selves, our actions become consistent with our identity. We no longer get caught up with chasing and running away from the perceptions of others. 

So, shift your focus away from self-esteem. Focus on you – your values, beliefs and your identity to live your authentic, best, life: develop your self-worth and self-esteem will follow."

MentalHealthUK,11/18/21 06:44:08,Sister has Psychosis or something similar,"Just looking for some advice if possible.

My sister, 26, has long suffered with anxiety and depression but of course has never had it professionally treated. 

Last week she took a turn for the worse and was suicidal along with having a breakdown/panic attack. She now believes that the 28th Oct 2021 has led to all of us, her family, being replaced and now she is paranoid and delusional about everything. Believes she is being filmed and that any treatment will be to hurt her.

I've tried everything I can think of and have been told but she refuses to get help and it is getting worse. The urgent crisis line, the GP, the Samaritans, 111, all say they have to speak to her before they can do anything and she will not.

Last week, when we were forced to call 999, she consented to getting a referral with them but because it was Sunday they couldn't call her GP themselves and it was left to us. Ringing the next day led to the GP refusing unless they spoke to her.

As such, I'm at a loss of what to do. Stuck waiting for her to try to hurt herself again before I can get her any real help.

I'd really like some advice if there's anything else we can try."

MentalHealthUK,11/17/21 19:51:49,INNER SAFE PLACES FOR DISSOCIATION,"A 5 min survey for 16 - 65 year olds **living in the UK**  
 

Hello, 

My name is Oliver and I am looking at creating a better and more accessible solution that helps those who have dissociation as part of my dissertation. I am currently making a solution that focuses on getting a person to apply the different senses and be able to personalise it based on objects that make them feel safe. My inspiration for this project came from wanting to help those closest to me to have dissociation. 

**THIS SURVEY ASKS ABOUT ONES SAFE PLACES TO GROUND THEMSELVES BEFORE DISSOCIATING** 

These are places or times that make you feel calm. For example you might use a shell to ground yourself because it reminds you of a beach and makes you feel safe and calm. It could be music that played in time when you felt happy and calm. These are only some examples. 

Please feel free to fill in this quick **5 min** survey to make a better solution if you are: 

* between 16 - 65 years old
* have dissociation 
* **living in the UK** 

Please find the survey link attached: [https://bournemouth.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/imaginary-safe-environments-for-dissociation](https://bournemouth.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/imaginary-safe-environments-for-dissociation)

Having seen it happen to those around me, I can imagine how difficult this is to go through. Therefore I will do my very best to keep this survey as safe as possible. I will keep questions: 

* completely voluntary and anonymous 
* **NOT** concerned with the cause of your dissociation 
* concerned only about developing a solution
* entirely your choice with which ones you choose to answer or not

Please fill in this survey until the **19th November,** if you have the time and the ease of mind for this. Your input could greatly help to develop a more accessible grounding tool for dissociation. 

Thank you,

Oliver "

MentalHealthUK,11/17/21 09:08:30,I'm pretty sure I just had a panic attack,"I woke up feeling very anxious and I had a sort of dream where I heard my mum's voice saying 'thats not taking into account that the parking cost £20'.  I felt my heart become heavy and I started to cry and all of my intrusive thoughts kept looping through my head and I felt dizzy. I drank some CBD oil and and sat outside for a bit and I feel fine now but what can of help can I get. I considered calling 101 and going to A and E  but I don't want to waste their time. I think I need help ASAP


For the last week these types of episodes have been common and sometimes they last an entire day. I'm very sucidial rn."
MentalHealthUK,11/17/21 07:27:04,On Sunday I got triggered and I haven't been okay since,"TW: suicide and maybe verbal abuse too?  
On Sunday someone DMed me ""Your preoccupation with your own mental illness is comical and telling. Grow the fuck up."" I don't think it's directly related to this sub because it was after I commented on some AskReddit threads. I tried to pretend it didn't happen. I mean I told the person they were just as fucked in the head as me but other than that I've really tried pretending it didn't happen but I can't.  
I question everything I think and say/ type because what kind of immature self centred idiot am I? Why can't I just get over myself and my stupid trauma. Why can't I ever just be happy? And worst of all it's really triggering my suicidal tendencies.  
I'm fighting as hard as I can because I've only got two weeks of therapy left, I really need to stay on this medication and I need to survive to see my favourite band in June next year, and I need to not have any more attempts because I bought a single ticket and if my family can't trust me then I won't be able to go.  
And like my therapist told me about the Service Users Network and I tried to call them this morning but no one picked up so I left a message but I haven't heard back from anyone and this is like one of my only lifelines after I finish therapy in two weeks.

  
I can't do this. I'm not going to kill myself but I just can't cope."
MentalHealthUK,11/17/21 03:58:54,Getting a private psychoanalysis?,"I've had depression for a long time and tried lots of treatments (including therapists and medications) which occassionally have some positive impact, but feel like they are treating surface symptoms rather than the real issue. Ultimately I always end up unsatisfied and suicidal. I have always felt like most of my issues are the result of something more distinct, but have never shed any light on this (and professionals I've seen haven't really tried).  
  
Can I get a professional to really go deep and see if they can identify a core problem? What is the right term for this? Where do I go looking for this service?  
  
I'm happy to go private with this, and would probably prefer to.  
  
-------------------------------More Context------------------------------------
  
Over the last few years I've been struggling pretty bad with my mental health, though it's probably been my whole life and I just only faced it as a problem more recently. I've tried several medications, CBT, a couple of therapists, lifestyle changes, etc. While a few of these things have had some seemingly positive effects, I'm still far from satisfied and find myself returning to a serious intention to commit suicide (though I think I'm probably still a good year or two away from acting on this intention).  
  
While depression has always been the big presenting issue, I have always felt like there is something bigger under the surface that is actually causing this. While I've been to the NHS and several private therapists, I've never been given any diagnosis (to my knowledge) beyond depression (I think there is something more specific than this), and never really been given any kind of deep analysis of what is going on at the core. I previously decided that this was too much to hope for, and tried to forget about it.  
  
Now I'm in my late 20s and just giving up on everything. I feel like I am wasting time with these treatments, and am overwhelmed by the number of small changes I could make that _could_ lead to some improvement. At the very least, I just want to know what is up (if there is something) just to put a name on it, and preferably I want some clear direction in how best to manage it."

MentalHealthUK,11/16/21 23:35:57,Gestalt Therapy and The Path to Wholeness,"**What Is Gestalt Therapy?**

Gestalt therapy is an integrative, client-centered, present-focused, embodied, and relational form of psychotherapy that aims to help clients increase their levels of awareness; claim responsibility for and accept the consequences of their actions; generate confidence in their abilities to make healthy choices; and release negative emotions, feelings, and life patterns.

On a broader scale, this form of therapy is focused on the notion of perception and seeks to help people understand how they give meaning to and make sense of their lives in the present moment. Today, numerous gestalt institutes exist around the world.

MentalHealthUK,11/16/21 23:34:33,Mental health team declined my referral,"So I’m currently under an eating disorder team as I have struggled with anorexia for a couple of years. But recently as I’ve been doing better they class me as ‘recovered’ and I can tell are pretty eager to discharge me from this service. My problem is that I suffer from severe social anxiety and PTSD. My care coordinator from the ED team made a referral for me to the community mental health team so they could help me with my anxiety and ptsd as the GP have also said there’s nothing else they can do for me. Well the CMHT declined the referral on the basis that I’ve suffered with anxiety for a long time and I’d get better help from CBT talking therapies - who I’ve already had 3 courses of therapy from and a course of DBT, all of which have not helped at all. Well now I just feel totally stuck. I’m on a med that doesn’t help me at all and I desperately need a medication review but since the GP can’t prescribe anything else and the CMHT won’t help me I feel like I’ve hit a brick wall. I’m just not sure what to do now as every day my mental health is getting worse"
MentalHealthUK,11/16/21 22:28:01,"PIP Health assessment says that ""I'm fine""...","Sorry, I need to vent about this. 

I had my PIP health assessment 2 weeks ago, on the advice I found online, I requested a copy to be sent to me as soon as possible. 

I received a copy of this today and I am so upset and angry over this. 

I am pretty much Agoraphobic, While I have not had a formal diagnosis from a psychiatrist, my GP and the results from a previous medical assessment have concluded the same (Evidence all provided...)

I don't go outside often/at all because I am shit scared. Last time I did, I had a massive panic attack over nothing. 

My partner has to handle my medications, collection of precriptions, organizing them for me to take and reminding me to do so. She cooks the majority of my meals and pretty much runs the house. 

However, because my GP is absolutely swamped and the NHS is absolutely swamped, there has been no progress with any further mental health service referrals since Feb of this year. 

So, because of all this, I am fine according to PIP.... what a bunch of cunts."
MentalHealthUK,11/16/21 20:36:09,Barred from crisis services and A&amp;E due to having BPD.,"I was told for years that I couldn't get help because I didn't have a diagnosis. They said it was likely BPD and I could be treated with DBT, but I'd need a diagnosis to get it. However, they were told not to diagnose people as too many people were faking symptoms to claim benefits (?). I fought for a few years and eventually got a diagnosis. However now I can't get any treatment at all. I wish I'd never been diagnosed because it seems to be stopping me from getting any support, but they wouldn't give me anything without it either!

They keep telling me nowhere here does DBT, even though there's an entire centre for DBT. They only accept referrals from the mental health team, but the mental health team are insisting that DBT does not exist here. It's in the same building I've had assessments done. Ive got a picture of the room that says ""DBT Service"" and pointed it out to the psychologist I was seeing, however I've been told I must be imaging it as they don't do DBT. They literally have a website with the address on, I feel like they're gaslighting me. One nurse told me that it was a sign I was starting to see things and make things up, which was attention-seeking behaviour and meant they couldn't treat me either.

I've attended A&amp;E over 350 times in 4 years. Every single time I'm sent home without being checked in or looked at, even after suicide attempts. Twice I was admitted, guarded by police officers and handcuffed to a chair, not allowed to use the toilet and kept there for 6 hours, only for a psychiatrist to call me a waste of space and send me home with a warning not to turn up again. I ended up with a serious kidney infection due to an overdose that wasn't checked out, however the complaint I put in came back and said due to my diagnosis of BPD, I cannot be treated in A&amp;E. If I call the crisis team, they can only suggest going to A&amp;E, so when I say I can't go, they tell me I'm lying and that I obviously don't want help if I won't go to A&amp;E. Now, the crisis line have been told not to speak to me at all because of my BPD. I  have also been diagnosed with PTSD and OCD, and they won't help me for either of these, because of my  BPD. I have been told I deserve to have PTSD, to understand the abuse I have done to others because of having BPD. I don't think I've ever abused anyone, nor have I said anything that could make them think that, I just keep being told that abusive is the default nature of someone with BPD. I  have complex trauma, and was referred to EMDR, but it made me worse since I can't regulate my emotions and it made me remember more traumatic events from my childhood. The therapist was really nice and concerned and felt bad for me, but said he had to refer me back to the mental health team as I wasn't ready for EMDR. They just referred me back to EMDR, to the same therapist, who was really validating and explained that EMDR is most effective for single event trauma, where its complex (my trauma happened over about 22 years) EMDR isn't often that effective. 

I can't sleep because every time I sleep I have very vivid flashback nightmares. It's been about 10 years since I could sleep without the nightmares and that was just for a few days here and there. Again, I have BPD so they have said I can't have any support with sleep. 

I am aware of the SIM scheme but no one will admit whether it runs here (Hull). 

I am struggling to hold down a job. I have no family or friends. I only really have myself. I can't make new friends as I got out of an abusive relationship 4 years ago and still can't go anywhere without being screamed at and kicked out (my ex told everyone I was the abuser, that it couldn't have been her that was abusive because I had a personality disorder). Thing is my ex and her friends don't live here anymore, it's all done via social media so moving away wouldn't help that. I don't have social media or post what I'm doing anywhere, but somehow they always find out. She's had me fired from jobs by telling them I've stalked her (hadn't seen or spoken to her in 3 years). She works for the police so whenever I've tried reporting it I just get told that she would never abuse me, police officers are there to protect people. My family were emotionally physically and sexually abusive and the mental health team STILL keeps suggesting that if I'm struggling I should contact my family for support. We have a Crisis Pad, but my sibling works there and I don't feel safe going there either, but the mental health team again tell me ""well you don't know when he works, you can't refuse to go because of him"", when he physically and sexually abused me when we were children. 

IAPT won't see me as my mental health is ""too severe"" for them. 

I've had 7 PALS complaints all come back with ""no evidence of any wrongdoing"" and have been told they will not take another complaint now (about mental health anyway). I just get the same thing - BPD is not treatable, so you have no right to any treatment. I have shown them the NICE guidelines that state my other conditions must be treated, but they say that PTSD and OCD can't be treated if you have BPD, as BPD makes you untreatable overall. 

I can't afford private at all. I saw there was one for £10 sessions, but you have to go 3 times a week. After bills, all I have left is £30 for food etc so I can't spend it all on therapy.

I've tried local support groups etc but they always turn me away saying they're not trained to deal with mental health like mine, only mild anxiety or depression. 

I stopped self-harming for 2 years and recently have started again. A few years ago I was told that because I didn't self harm, I couldn't qualify for help. Now I'm self-harming again they say I don't qualify BECAUSE I self harm. It's like they change the entry requirements based on what I'm doing at the time. They did this with alcohol too - ""if you consume ANY alcohol at all you can't be treated"" so I stopped drinking entirely, then it was ""well if you don't drink then you obviously manage fine so you can't have treatment"". 

No one seems to care about my mental health. It makes me mad that most of my disorders were caused by abuse and trauma. My parents, my ex, my teachers and peers in school who abused me all get to live their lives with no consequences for what they did to me. I want help to get my own life back and I keep getting turned away. 

I recently had to go through withdrawal from venlafaxine which was awful, eyes rolling into the back of my head, constant shaking and sweating, feeling like I was being electrocuted... all because a psychiatrist (that I've never spoken to) told my GP to stop my medication with no warning, because the psychiatrist said that BPD can't be treated, so it's a waste of money to give me medication. My GP wouldn't budge. I'm now unmedicated and struggling to keep myself safe, yet A&amp;E will turn me away (I went a few days ago) and the Crisis team hangs up as soon as I give them my name.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do anymore. I was told to contact Mind's legal team but they don't take individual cases and told me I'd have to pay a solicitor, which again I can't afford."
MentalHealthUK,11/16/21 19:36:52,Getting a diagnosis in UK,"I'm wondering the best way to go about this. I have suffered with mental health problems for as long as I can remember and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 6 years ago. I have OCD too but not diagnosed. My family has a history of mental health problems though and I truly believe it's more than depression and anxiety.

 I didn't really have an understanding GP previously but I have a new one in the past few months who seems better. Previously I gave up seeking help partly out of frustration and partly because my physical health had took priority. I'm wondering if I should approach the subject again with my new GP? 

I have an appointment tomorrow as he has put me back on Sertraline and advised he would call a week later to check up on me. I'm just completely unsure what to say but I know I have a lot in my head from going back years I need to get out and just want to understand what it all means.

MentalHealthUK,11/16/21 04:53:44,CAMHS,"I really need some help. In short, I’ve been severely mistreated by CAMHS. After asking for maybe around a year I finally got a psychiatrist appointment and in the psychiatrist appointment she didn’t do anything and just discharged me with no help. After writing an appeal we got a second psychiatric opinion and it’s maybe in a month or two. In the last appointment I told her that my life was currently at risk and I am harming myself and I really tried to emphasise how bad it was but I’m autistic so it was really hard. I was just wondering what language to use to get them to take you seriously. Because I really planned out what I was going to say and made it sound imminent yet they still did nothing and I can’t mess this appointment up. I’ve never been diagnosed or treated or given medication with my 5 years with CAMHS."

MentalHealthUK,11/16/21 01:57:40,Is there a better alternative to Promethazine (for sleep)?,"Hello, since promethazine has a half-life of 16-19 hours, I wonder if there is an alternative to this drug with the same efficacy but with a shorter half-life?

Before I tried Calmaben (Diphenhydramine ) but it didn't help me to stay asleep even when I took 100mg (2 tabs). 

Even though promethazine seems to be helpful for staying asleep, it's been quite hard to deal with the next day's side effects, such as brain fog, drowsiness, and general cognitive impairment that can last until noon. I also need to take more now, since I've already developed a tolerance to 25mg. 

I wonder if there are any antihistamine medications with a shorter half-life and available on the European market?

I still want to try though and need to know how to navigate the system so I can avoid as much of that crap as possible and get actual help. I'm having a really hard time managing everyday tasks at this point I really need help urgently and actual help rather than dismissal.

MentalHealthUK,11/15/21 12:41:38,Protest At The Systems Of Sectioning Psychiatric Patients For Mental Health By the NHS UK,"Sectioning Patients of Mental Health

It is a form of false imprisonment

If the state has taken a dislike for you they shall use Section as tool and system that shall oppress you and imprison a person at mental health facilities

Having discussed this topic with others I have heard that a person was section a single time and never brought back.

This patient has been brought back a few times for section through no fault of my own with the state not making efforts whilst at the community to prevent me from being sectioned.

I am a psychiatric patient and I am protesting the idea that a persons existence and private life should interrupted for a Section 2 of the mental health act for assessment of psychiatric health which is a form of false imprisonment without trial.

Because I have been sectioned a few times I shall protest I have been asked the question why do I get sectioned so much I believe it is because of dislike from the state and their belief that enforcing false imprisonment Section 2 section is trivial when it is not trivial at all.

I believe the reason that I have been sectioned a few times however always leave is because the team at the community does not work hard for making sure that I do not return.

At the past I was forced have clozapine when my preferred medication was quetiapine I was not even allowed a choice of medication that I wanted I was forced accept and take the medication the unwelcoming NHS psychiatrist gave me and they refused give me the quetiapine when the quetiapine is far better for me.

I am protesting at the system of sectioning someone at the mental health act for these reasons. A section is form of false imprisonment whether legal or not. Someone would be section just for a single report from a stranger or citizen from the community and it is not taken into consideration the value and the trustworthiness of the word of these reports. The reports are accepted where the validity of the words of the report are right or not are considered.

A section 2 at the mental health act is for assessment and it is a 28 day section. I am protesting because sectioning someone at the mental health act takes them away from their place of residence for goverment and state facilities the food is poor the facilities are poor the beds are poor the staff disrespect food deliveries are difficult you are not allowed leave and all this just for a mental health psychiatric assessment.

Another reason for protest is that the psychiatric staff do not attempt to help you leave they try and keep me it is form of false imprisonment because it is imprisonment without trial and try and make you stay trying and make you stay shows that their assessment would not be open minded and generous for the psychiatric patients argument.

Lastly if it is an assessment it should be done in the community and it should not be done in government facilities which are poor and removing a patient and british citizen from their place of residence simply for psychiatric and mental health.

I am protesting this system and I am protesting the laws in place that allow this system for be facilitated."
MentalHealthUK,11/15/21 12:21:38,Questionable advice from care coordinator?,"Hi, I’m posting this on behalf of my roommate, who I act as unofficial carer for. He’s recently been going through the process of getting help for his mental health through our local CMHT. He has been having symptoms of psychosis since he was 3 (he’s now 23). He also suffers with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. He has never been a danger to himself or others. 

And that brings me onto the main issue. He just recently had his first appointment with his care coordinator and she spent the entire session strongly pushing for him to move into a place called Frogmore Court. She framed her suggestion as being motivated by her desire for him to have proper support, and continuously referred to Frogmore Court as supported housing.

However, when we got home and looked at the leaflet she provided him, alarm bells immediately went off in my head as at the top of the leaflet it says that it’s a Look Ahead property. Now, I’ve been in three homeless hostels, two of which were run by Look Ahead. So naturally I began to suspect that Frogmore was also a homeless hostel.

When me and my roommate googled Frogmore Court, we found information about the place on a site called homeless link, and in the section where it says who they help, it says “Young single homeless people aged 16-25. Must have a local connection.”

Now, I’m sure you can gather from the fact that I’ve been referring to my friend as my roommate that we have a home. It is a stable living situation with no immediate risk of homelessness.

I completely understand that these hostels can offer support to their residents, but both me and my roommate don’t understand why this place is being put forward for him when the support he needs could very easily be provided for him without being moved to what looks to be a homeless hostel.

Does anyone have any advice? Is this a more logical suggestion than we think it is? Or should we maybe get a new care coordinator for him?"
MentalHealthUK,11/15/21 08:47:51,drug counseling,"I was once already referred for booze due Od unrelated issue but turn down offer due thinking it would waste of time, seeing as I’m not daily alcoholic but a binge drink who frequently does so to cope with mental health, I guess self medicating.

Now are clinics worth attending, I’m desperate to quit but at same time all provider can provide, I feel  is ways of coping, there no medication treatment for my situation and Just feel like wasting there time with more serious people needing help."

Im someone who’s “high functioning” with depression/anxiety (diagnosed) and I just feel like I can’t cope alone, some days are totally fine but some days i just feel like hiding somewhere and breaking down.

I cant really rely on family due to stigma relating to mental health so i don’t really know where else to turn. Ideally I’d want to have some form of therapy as i believe that would help but i just don’t have the finances to go private and unfortunately the NHS is just not sufficient.

MentalHealthUK,11/14/21 22:54:57,Can my GP diagnose me with GAD,"Posted from ask a doctor subreddit

Hi, I'm 18F and live in the UK, so let me know if this is the wrong sub for this.

I've struggled with anxiety for a long time, like since I was about 12 and although it's been recognised by multiple mental health specialists and CAHMS (Went for an autism assessment and the reports mostly discuss that they believe I have anxiety) and I spoke to my GP earlier this year, who prescribed me 50mg sertraline ever day, which had helped significantly. However I'm pretty sure that this doesn't count as a diagnosis, which means my university can't give me any support or special considerations or whatever, which I find myself in need of (My high school would just provide those things without a diagnosis, and even then I plummeted, as many did, mentally during the 3rd UK lockdown, so I wasn't as in need back then.)

So even though I've put this through google a few times it never gives me a straight answer. I want a diagnosis - can I ask my GP for that or do I have to go through the torment that is self-referral/waiting for a referral/CAHMS etc? I was given a blood test that came back as saying that I was anaemic but otherwise healthy, which I know can be a part of the process sometimes?

Thanks!"
MentalHealthUK,11/14/21 06:34:02,Looking at my positives right now,"My therapist emailed me some info about a support group for people with personality disorders and people who have difficulties with emotional regulation and managing distress and stuff. My anxiety is terrified (hate social situations, hate new places and new people lol) but I think this could be a really good connection for me especially as I'm finishing this round of therapy soon and I'm not sure when I'll start therapy again. I'm definitely going to try to go at least twice.  


I've also started writing a journal again. I wrote one about 6-8 years ago but I stopped when my mental health got super bad for the first time. At the time I also stopped being able to read even though it was one of my favourite pass times because there were too many thoughts I couldn't concentrate. Anyway, I've started actually writing in a notebook again and I kind of think it's better than venting on reddit (which I have done for a while because I used it as a replacement after I grew out of childline), especially because I always forget to check back on my posts and answer any replies.  


Ahh I started going on several tangents sorry. I'll try to remember to check back on replies this time! And I've promised now so I have to.  


TL;DR: Might go to a support group thing with people who I might be able to relate to and also started writing a journal again."
MentalHealthUK,11/14/21 01:05:52,Struggling to find reasons,"My ex tried to stab me with a knife, I pushed her away and she got hurt blah blah I ended up with an assault charge because no evidence to what I said, she claimed I assaulted her for no reason with some extra spice added in also.  So my character is fucked.  I don't think I did anything wrong yet I'm being punished for it.  


This year, a young lassie at work confided in me, said one of the older guys was groping her etc etc so we got him sacked but his mates within the department have bullied me non stop.  I've had little to no support from HR or mgmt and I'm off work due to it so now I'm going on to half pay which means many more problems.  I don't think I've done anything wrong yet I'm being punished for it.  


I have no family in my life.  The few friends I have are not getting in touch with me anymore and I'll be fucked if I'm the one reaching out first all the time (I've been fully transparent about whats going on btw but mh issues are such a drag to deal with smh).

So basically I'm at a point where there is literally nothing keeping me in this world.  I am fully intending to commit suicide and I've researched the most comfortable way I can manage to do it (too clever for my own good).  My next (half lol) pay I'm going to cancel all the direct debits the day before I'm paid.  Use that money for a hedonistic week or so, get the stuff I need and do it.

There is a guy I speak to every couple of weeks (some kind of psych guy I don't really know) because I asked for help and next week I'm due to speak to him again but I'll tell him what he needs to hear so I don't raise too many concerns and get locked up in some shitty ward.  


I guess if I was reading this I'd say you need to get help.  I'm 40, I've had mh issues my entire life, even before adult hood.  Primary 2, my teacher sent a letter home saying I wasn't normal and I need some help.  Parents went mad (oh how I wish they took that with both hands, my life could be so different).  Late teens I went to the GP about social anxiety, got some CBT training which was kinda ok but there wasn't any real work done about what else was wrong with me.  In my 20's I went to the GP again saying there's something wrong with me, I don't know what it is but I think it might be this.  Got told it was fashionable to have mh issues.  Argued the case, got sent to some psych department for a review thing and she shouted at me and to stop wasting her time (she was showing off in front of a student nurse).  I went to the GP in my 30's and got told to take pills for a year and come back then.  Late 30's went back again same results, mocking, take some pills and I got the message finally... nobody gives a fuck so please don't tell me I need to try to get help I've fucking tried it's the system that has let me down.  


I don't know why I'm writing this out because in my head I am fully committed.  I need to express it, yes, but maybe I'm missing something else and perhaps one of you kind folks can point it out to me but right now, I **REFUSE** to go through my 40's carrying the psychological pain and torture I've carried through my 20's and 30's."
MentalHealthUK,11/13/21 19:22:39,How do I contact CAMHS after discharge?,I have been to CAMHS in over a year but it’s vital I contact them regarding a diagnosis they made which does not appear on my new mental health record. I’ve looked them up and can’t find any sort of email address. I’d also like to access my notes if possible.
MentalHealthUK,11/13/21 07:16:13,Need some advice on what I can expect from my GP,"Before moving city my previous GP made an urgent referral to my mental health team and tried to setup a blood test, unfortunately both were unsuccessful as I had moved away and they said my new GP would need to make these arrangements.

I’ve since had an appointment with my new GP and they’ve not made any kind of referral (or recommended a blood test) and have just put me on new medication.

I understand I probably should have asked them about this in the appointment but I always find it difficult to talk about my mental health troubles and this is only exasperated by the nervousness I feel when speaking on the phone. This is not helped when it feels like I’m always being interrupted and I feel like they don’t really want to hear how troubled I am so that they can get away with just prescribing new medicine and calling it a day.

I sent my new GP the referral letter my old GP made but when they spoke to me it was as if they had no context of the predicament I’m in.

Do I have a right to be annoyed by how I’m being treated or is it just a case of me needing to speak up more in my appointments?

Understand this is probably an incomprehensible ramble at this point, perhaps looking at my post history will give more context, but any advice would be appreciated.

Many thanks."

They don't say anything that I can make out but not really sure what to do. 

I did get a telephone appointment with my GP but I had to pick up medication, he called at 5:42pm to issue it and the pharmacy closed at 6pm. I mentioned that I have started hearing things and it scared me but he said go pick up my medication. I could phone for another appointment next week but not sure he can or will help. 

It is worse when I am alone, I live with my parents. Does anyone have any advice? I would like the whispering to go away but I am not sure what to do or what to say to the GP. Its difficult just to get my current medication and I am on a waiting list for a group education thing from the mental health team.

MentalHealthUK,11/13/21 04:15:14,Informal patient at a mental hospital,"So, I am currently staying in a secure facility (although I am here informally, so can leave when I like). I've been here 3 days, saw a consultant on day 1 and I found him very good, but since then I have had zero interactions with staff, zero activities (short staffed), zero encouragement. Not much of anything. I'm expected to just hang about on the ward and talk to the other residents. I did have an interaction with a health care assistant a couple of nights ago, but I didn't find it helpful at all. I told her that I hate my responsibilities as a parent and find every day a struggle. Her response was that 'everyone feels like that sometimes'. I felt so stupid and pathetic. 
I have no idea what the plan is for me, moving forward. I was told in my meeting with the consultant that some kind of therapy would be happening, but as for what and when, I'm in the dark. 

Is this about right for people in my position? Or is this facility seriously lacking?

I’m not sure about in other places but here they are a complete joke. Every time I’ve been admitted for self harm or suicidal behaviour they’ve just sent me home. One of them even yelled at me. My Mum had to practically force them to admit me. I had just taken an overdose and was hearing voices and wanted to run away and live outside and they just said “the safest place for you is in your bed”. Do they just not believe I am unwell?

MentalHealthUK,11/12/21 10:29:11,"I realized I have no values. All my behavior thus far in life has been one, continuous, elaborate attempt to control others’ responses to me. Everything else is secondary.","I’m 24, for context, in treatment for depression and anxiety symptoms, but I almost wonder if I have a personality disorder of some kind due to the rigidity of my way of existing.

Today in therapy my therapist was asking me about what I value, what am grateful for about myself or what I like about myself, and/or things that make me feel proud of myself. This is so important to me and the root of my problems but it’s also so painful and confusing because I literally have no idea. I couldn’t answer. I feel like a empty and soul-less person in a way. I was going to say terrible but that’s not exactly true. Just empty like I have no soul or purpose. That’s a terrible thing though and it’s no wonder I don’t like myself. The problem now is I don’t know how to go forward. I can say I value kindness and want to be nice and treat others well which is true but he said I have to really believe in my values and not in order to get anything from others (like love or acceptance in return). I have to either believ I embody that value or if not figure out how to move toward it.

I don’t know what to chose or how to go about any of it. I wrote some stuff down but I’m not even sure I believe it. I feel sad and disappointed in myself a bit, for not having lived a very meaningful or purpose driven existence, or for having integrated any kind of moral compass into my life yet, and for having so much difficulty with it. I know that’s not a good mindset to have, to dwell on the past, or think about how I should be farther along than I am. Still it’s just strange. I feel embarrassed, morally, in front of my therapist. He seems to have a such clear goals and focus in his life. I feel like I should at least have an easier time implementing this simple tool instead of fretting over and being confused by it. I’m trying not to generalize about what it means about me “as a person” but that is my instinct.

I feel like I’m very much living in a totally different mode, one that is completely consumed by getting my needs met by others. It’s like suddenly realizing my whole life up to this point has been one long elaborate scheme to make my environment be what I want it to be and give me what I want it to give me. Instead of acting and making decisions based on values, goals, principles or anything like that, I usually act in an attempt to get people to respond to me in a certain way. So I act submissively to avoid potential conflicts and to make myself less likely to be the target of any negative feelings of other people, for example. Other times I might dress or act seductively in an attempt to make someone else desire me (which makes me feel good, desirable). I answer questions in class the way I think my teacher wants me to so they like me more, praise me, etc. if I am not trying to get anything from someone or avoid someone behaving a certain Way toward me, I usually do not engage with them, except for a very few close friends with whom I am curious, empathetic and myself. But these friends are extremely rare. I am usually acting out from an extremely selfish place of “how can I get what I “need” in this situation and/or avoid what is uncomfortable, unpleasant and painful” then I do everything possible to ensure those two outcomes. It’s so sad!"

MentalHealthUK,11/12/21 02:51:09,NHS outpatient team are plotting against me to bring me down,"tl;dr - i'm not a dud, and the outpatient unit in my NHS hospital see me as such, and they take great delight in abusing me. but i know they don;'t do this to others, and see them as whole people. Therapy is bullshit overall, since they're not ethical nor professional and they just pick and choose whom to treat to any standard.

i see this outpatient clinic in my country (UK). and i reckon they all see me as the dud to try and fuck me over. they tell the other people there acceptable stuff, but not me. they have a preconception about me, and think they can act on that preconception.

Like I go once per fortnight, and they always tell me stuff to try and put me down and keep me down. as if i'm a scrunt or a nothing. like i said i was planning to go to university, and they said that I wasn't good enough and i'd stand out since I canot cook. erm..there are grown people who don't know how to cook always. so what?? they also said why am I going outside of the town i live in...why can't I? part of the uni experience to go out of town for a new experience to and live and learn. and they that sheltered and DIM??

On another session they asked me what i did that morning. i said (in honesty) that I got up later than normal and started to look at porn and chat on sex message boards. they said this was a sin and i shouldn't look at porn. i said i spent the night before playing video games, and they said that was a sin.

they also say that because I ""look intelligent"" (whatever that means) I deserve to be beaten up and that I cannot partake in normal life. who are they to say what I should do? and why are their bs beliefs of who looks like what relevant to me?

They then say often that I should go to church, and I should despise LGBT people since they are scum.

I told them outright that i won't, and they are plotting agaisnt me to tell me nonsense. I just left them, and have threatened for them to section me (which is to detain a person on mental health grounds in my country).

I know they have their favourites, whom they see as whole people without prejudice. Like there is this Youtuber who lives in the same country as I do, and has worse issues, like autism, suicide attempts, past sexual abuse, etc. but then in her NHS environment, they allow her to have an onlyfans account, have extensive body tattoos and stuff since they apparently see her as a whole person, and not me. I think it's because she's white and pretty, and even the non-white pros she sees probably fancy her to. [https://www.instagram.com/p/CWI57ektZSv/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWI57ektZSv/) So aren't we both human? why does race or looks have any bearing here? it shouldn't.

but not for me. i can't be seen against the metric since they want to plot and hurt me.

Well the joke's on them. I'm uni educated, i see porn, and i don't go to church. i even post pics on sex sites too. will they section me then? why not? why are I denied NORMALCY but others are handed it to them based on how they look or what colour their skin is?

I'm tired of plotters, cowboys, unprofessional people, and losers. If they want to ""beat me 'because I look smart'"" then they can go ahead. They're the ones who will spend weeks, nay months, in an intensive care unit, not me. And if they tell the police, they'd get no sympathy. They can pray to their pastors to heal them, i don't care."

MentalHealthUK,11/12/21 00:31:27,Any advice on how I can get a diagnosis? TW for mention of attempt,"Hi. Female, 24 years old.

I have been having symptoms of OCD for years, all physical possibilities have been ruled out. A GP I saw a while ago suggested it sounded like OCD. Last year I attempted suicide (didn't go to hospital once I woke up, I just moved on), and about a month later referred myself to an IAPT service. I told them about the OCD type symptoms, did one of those anxiety and depression tests which I scored quite high on. However because I had attempted just a month earlier (I told them it was self harm as I was concerned about being hospitalised, although in hind sight that might have been the best thing for me) they wouldn't/couldn't help. 

If I make an appointment with a private psychiatrist, will they be able to give me a diagnosis once they've heard my symptoms, or do I need to see a therapist? I can't afford therapy privately, but i'm wondering maybe if I can get a diagnosis I can work with my GP on medication while I wait for therapy on the NHS? I don't know, i'm a bit lost on what to do at the moment."
MentalHealthUK,11/11/21 23:12:25,Do I want a BPD diagnosis?,"( I'm in the UK for context)

I've had problems with my mental health for a while now.i spoke to a few different therapists who I just didn't click with- they would always pick specific things to focus on as if that's the problem, but what I struggle with changes on a weekly/daily basis, and I knew the real problem must be something deeper that just manifests itself in different ways.
I finally found a wonderful CBT therapist who really listened to me and understood I was more interested in understanding the bigger picture. I stumbled across BPD completely by accident, but when we looked into it together we realised that it really does sound a lot like me. Around the end of the course, I was due to move house and still confused about whether I wanted to pursue a diagnosis. So my therapist wrote a letter for my new GP to read basically listing why she thinks I fit the criteria so that I don't have to go back to the beginning again. 
I spoke to my GP, and they basically said ""are you sure you want a diagnosis? I don't think you do...' and told me to self-refer with another service, saying they would be able to help more. 
The other service turns out to only really offer counselling or CBT for depression and anxiety. The woman I spoke to for an assessment suggested another course of CBT since I'm also just generally an anxious person, and told me honestly that she doesn't even know the signs of BPD so couldn't tell me if she thought it was relevant or not. 
So now I'm not sure what to do. I know I shouldn't be so fixated on something without an actual diagnosis, but it's the only thing that really fits. I don't know if I can go all the way back to the beginning again. I felt like I finally had a possible answer and I was actually getting somewhere and I don't want to lose that. Even if I don't actually have BPD, Im at least pretty sure I have attachment issues and I feel like it would make far more sense to take this into account rather than going back to doing really generic things that don't really fit me? Should I just go through with the CBT again and see what the new therapist thinks? Should I see if my doctor surgery has any doctors with more of an interest in mental health so that I can just have a proper chat about what options I have? I'm just feeling a bit lost and frustrated, and I would really appreciate any advice.

I have cross-posted this from r/bpd, just to see if anyone might be able to help!"
MentalHealthUK,11/11/21 18:56:48,Can I ask to change anxiety medication after almost a year?,"Hey all,

I've been on Sertraline since December last year for anxiety and depression, and for the record, it's worked quite well. I started off on a low dose, and my doctor slowly increased it, I'm on 100mg now. 

The past couple of months though my anxiety has been getting worse. I've been so anxious that I've felt incredibly nauseous; I've actually thrown up quite a few times and I've found that I often shake a lot. I have to carry a bottle of water with me at all times because water calms me down a little. 

My depression has been fine, however my anxiety levels have shot up. Because my meds are working for my depression but not the anxiety, I'm not sure if I'll be able to ask my doctor about changing medication.

I'm also nervous about switching meds because it took a long time for me to find antidepressants that worked for me, and I'm cautious that I'll have to start the cycle all over again."

MentalHealthUK,11/11/21 08:03:16,How to go about asking for anxiety medication?,"I’ve been struggling with social anxiety and having multiple panic attacks daily for practically all my life. I only really realised what it was when I was around 12. I’m 20 now and haven’t improved at all, in fact I think I feel worse. I had friends then, whilst I don’t have any now and haven’t had any for three years. I’m realising now that before I had the structure of school and stuff so I could get away with not talking much, by doing what I’m told, but now I need to get out into the adult world where I have to take initiative. That’s already a pretty stressful transition for all people but having social anxiety is really making it hard. I barely leave the house. I’ve been to the GP at 16, where they referred me to cahms for mild anxiety. I highly doubt my anxiety was mild. In their defence, I was too scared to tell them I had panic attacks since I didn’t even know what I felt was a panic attack. But anyways… it didn’t help at all. It felt so draining to expose myself and my thoughts. 
Fast forward to now, I decided to get help again. My mum called the GP who sent us a link to iCope where I got referred to CBT. I’m on a waiting list for 5 months. I’m getting really nervous about growing up as time goes. I’ve missed out on all my teens and I don’t want to lose my twenties either. I tried a free trial for betterhelp where I was told I should ask the GP for medication since I’ve been experiencing this for years. 

How would I even go about asking for medication? All my life I thought that the GP or therapist would offer it to you if therapy wasn’t working well and that it was out of the question to even request them. 

I kinda wish I knew of this earlier.

Also what are your experiences with the different medication? I know they all work differently on everyone, but which would you recommend for someone with social anxiety that has multiple panic attacks a day?"
MentalHealthUK,11/11/21 04:23:56,Should secondary services be...helping me?,"Hey so, a couple of months ago I was referred to the CMHT after nine years of being fobbed off by my GP, sent on IAPT CBT and given SSRI's over and over. My therapist witnessed me having a hypomanic episode which triggered the referral, and led to me being diagnosed with bipolar 2 and OCD. 

Since then, aside from being mood stabilisers, nothing has happened and I don't know whether it should. I feel like I need some support with identifying my mood changes and my anxiety is pretty debilitating. My psychiatrist keeps mentioning referring me onto some courses but when I ask for this they're very vague on what they are and when they'd start, and doesn't seem to have actually...referred me to them? 

I know the MH services are struggling, but I'm really struggling still and I'm not sure how to go about asking for some more support without coming across like I'm nagging or anything."
MentalHealthUK,11/10/21 23:28:02,Best/Cheapest Way to Get a Private Appointment (ADHD),"I've been on an NHS waiting list for an ADHD assessment for over 18 months and I can't wait anymore, it's unbearable.

Even IAPT sounded more serious than secondary services. Piss take. Told you’d be diagnosed and receive therapy. Receive a load of bullshit and sugar coated courses. 

I have relapsed, s harming everyday and have been feeling in void black out coma from dissociation.  Up and down. 

I have no faith in private places. They will just say Dr. Google this, mindfulness that, headspace this and fuck off that also. 

I want help. I need fucking help. Not some all magical fairy mindfulness course, meeting an impatient, couldn’t care less person once a week and bollocks SSRI’s or whatever for “symptoms” of something they haven’t even diagnosed. 

I need the help that will fucking break me into nothing and re build me again. I cannot get any worse than I am now. That is a fact. Any worse I would would be in a mental hospital.

The issue I have is I am very stress about other things at the moment and am finding it hard to put the emotional effort into maintaining my friendship with O.  It is not because of O but my desire to run away and hide from the world.

I decided to run out, no shoes or anything. I asked to leave but they said they’d detain me, which isn’t even allowed. just needed to get the hell out of there.

MentalHealthUK,11/10/21 04:05:01,Refused to give me medication,"I am depressed, I have been diagnosed with depression since 2015. Since then I have had a myriad of other diagnosis including EUPD.

About 8 weeks ago I came off my antidepressants and I was stable throughout this time but unfortunately some events in my life has now set me back. 

I live in a mental health rehab hospital. 

Thursday evening I decided it would be best to prevent me falling into that pit and go back on antidepressants because of things that week and that day that knocked me back.

Friday a doctor saw me (not specifically trained as a GP or as a mental health practitioner). And she suggested perhaps mood stabilisers would be better.

Saturday my Primary Nurse even said she could understand why I would need an antidepressant.

I thought about it over the weekend and knew that from previous knowledge it wouldn’t be best as I’m having low periods and a mood stabiliser may continue giving me those low moods (this was also told to me ages back it isn’t the best option till I’m out of that low point). Anyways the dr from Friday she would mention it to the dr specific in mental health.

So he sees me today. His solution - do a mood diary for 10 days and then he will see how much I need it. He even laughed about how I get depressed with assignments and basically shot me down. He said if I went on antidepressants they would only just kick in when my assignment was due despite telling him previous successful antidepressants haven’t ever really taken that long to at least do the minimum. Then he was saying how well I did with previous assignments and I had to remind him that I was medicated well at those times! 

So I call my GP after all this and she agrees that she can see a need. She says she would call me back but didn’t, so I call back and the surgery are basically saying their hands are tied because of this dr I saw earlier.

I’m currently waiting for 111 to call me and see what they say, but I’m so angry and hurt right now that staff here are downplaying my emotions and making jokes about how it’s ridiculous for my need to be depressed over uni assignments. 

All I want is to prevent the cycle I have always ended up in when things start going south for me and I don’t know what more I can do."
MentalHealthUK,11/10/21 02:12:51,"I know the NHS mental health system sucks, but the private mental health system is also shockingly bad","I’m going through a mental health crisis since I got gastritis back in May.

I have private healthcare, so thought I’d arrange to see a psychiatrist and get on the right medication. Lo and behold it’s been like jumping through hoops. First I have to get referred through a GP, who send me home with a propranolol prescription half the time, then 1 GP finally does and it takes ages to hear back. I finally hear back and it’s from some shitty middleman called Nuffield health who barely communicate with me, and take weeks to respond to emails. I finally saw the psychiatrist in September and she brushed off the anxiety issues, told me I possibly have ADHD but to confirm I’d need to rebook with Nuffield health. Now I’m in NOVEMBER and I’ve heard fuck all from them. I’m getting seriously desperate, I need to get out of this situation before I become an agoraphobe. The government wonder why so many people abuse drugs and I can tell them exactly why, it’s because there is literally nowhere to turn if you ever find yourself facing a crisis. Pisstake."

MentalHealthUK,11/10/21 00:32:13,Mental health advice for trauma,"I will preface this with the fact I am happy to be redirected to alternative posts, just exhausted and in a bit of a state so I haven't looked in detail.

I have been under the NHS this year for my mental health issues. Ive ended up going from crisis to crisis as my symptoms are getting worse. Emotional, body etc flashbacks are coming at me from all sides and I am struggling with nightmares as well as showering etc. I have attempted multiple times this year, the last attempt leaving me in hospital 5 days narrowly avoiding inpatient. I knew I was about to attempt yesterday and called my community team 3 times where noone was able to talk to me, I then called 999 as I didn't know what else to do. I spoke to some lovely people in hospital who took me quite seriously and in the end I was given the choice of inpatient or crisis team. I chose the crisis team as inpatient would likely be very traumatic, I was promised a psychiatrist appointment the next day and support.

There was no psychiatrist appointment today as they messed up the booking, so I talked to the crisis team in the office. There I was told as I am very sensitive to medication and my issues were not something they could medicate they couldn't help me. They are seeing me on Thursday and that is it. I was told to talk to my care coordinator or my (private) therapist.

I talked to my care coordinator today after she arranged to see me. She asked why I was upset I hadn't seen a psychiatrist as I had said I didn't think it was likely medication could help. I said it was because I was hoping to talk about possibly getting a referral somewhere that specialised in trauma and dissociation as it's what I am struggling with most. I was then drawn a diagram about how me wanting this referral had caused me to act out. I disagreed but left it asking how she could help. I was talked in circles for 20+ minutes until I decided I couldn't take anymore circles today and said I had had enough. I was told to be realistic and to do more ""calming"" exercises as only I can really help myself. I mentioned I was struggling with the basics and was then told if I was in crisis I should be working with the crisis team or going to A&amp;E which I had already done and been told people couldn't help.

I don't know if I am being really dense, or something. But noone seems able to offer me help I rather desperately need? My therapist is helping but there is only so much one person can do considering how much I am struggling right now. I don't see how inpatient will help, I cannot really be medicated or even really kept safe as they keep telling me. I don't drink, do drugs or even smoke. Am I missing something??? Am I going about this wrong? I feel I've honestly tried my best to get help but don't know where else to turn.

They have given me a BPD diagnosis but don't seem interested in addressing the trauma that's ruling my life, the only BPD symptoms I have are ones that cross over with PTSD or CPTSD.

Thanks for listening, fair if you don't have any advice, but I would appreciate any."
MentalHealthUK,11/09/21 19:32:24,"It feels like I'll never get anywhere with processing a childhood trauma, and I don't know when I'll get help!","~~I don't know if I'll post this... just needed to get it off my chest.~~   
I had an 'initial consultation' over the phone in September. Since then I've waited 8 weeks for another appointment and it's so frustrating! I'm trying to do stuff for myself (using online self-help and books etc.) but I know having someone to talk to about very specific things - SA, and Trauma would be what would help most. It's something that I keep circling around to again and again when I think about why I do certain things or behave in a certain way. Especially why I've fallen into the habit of dissociation when I'm not comfortable somewhere, or need to have strict control to feel safe. 

 I got so close to seeing someone about my SA 5 years ago, when I first went to counselling, but I didn't feel ready to talk about things like that then. I was in a really dissociative state at the time and probably couldn't have talked about it if I wanted to. 

In the meantime, I went to counselling within my university for 6 months when I was starting to process it. Probably wasn't the best place to talk about it, or else they weren't trained to deal with traumas, because in the brief time I saw that counsellor

\- I was asked 'why' I thought he did it  
\- and if he had any learning difficulties (basically meaning it wasn't his fault) 

I've tried to talk to my parents about it - after having several intense emotional episodes while I was in a uni house and quite isolated, but they say that they don't know what to do to help me. Meanwhile, my dad still associates with the father of the abuser (as recently as yesterday) which feels really invalidating because he's someone I don't feel comfortable being around either.

Even worse and what sticks out in my mind is when I explained what had gone on just this year, he said that he ""knew *something* was wrong, but didn't do anything about it because I didn't say anything."" I couldn't physically do that, and I got trapped in a freeze response for a long time, which made me unable to speak. That was my biggest flaw, I did well in school but I was quiet. 

I don't really have anywhere where I can talk because what I say about how I'm feeling just gets shut down. In fact, my family are pretty emotionally constipated, to be honest, and I'm not very good at opening up myself - especially to people I know, for fear they'll judge me that I'm still this tied up in something that happened to me over 13 years ago.   


The closest thing I have is a university friend who I talk to occasionally and understands the situation. My university housemates have only seen me have a breakdown, I haven't managed to open up to them about it. In the end, I just want to know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and I will get to go through this stuff with a therapist at some time. It feels pretty distant right now."

I came out of my isolation period not too long ago and I find that I am anxious about everything even things that don't matter. I worry if I'll lose my job, if my phone or computer dies or loses battery too quickly, if I miss my bus or something. I worry about my family's health because we live a few hundred miles away (this obviously does matter) and I cannot catch a break.

My heart is burning and it feels like my head is in a vice. I work, watch TV to distract my mind from things. I don't talk to people on the phone anymore because it gives me anxiety and causes my heart rate to increase. 

I don't know what is wrong but I can't stop and I feel like I'm in an abyss I can't get out of. Admittedly I have taken illegal substances which haven't helped in the long-run but they provided an escape.

What in the actual fuck.  Like the title says it all, I just don’t know what to do.  I feel beyond overwhelmed.  I don’t want to kill myself, at least not right now for whatever reason.  I keep feeling like there’s some hope but I just don’t know what I’m hoping for.  Everything is falling apart at the seems and I’m no longer slowly unravelling, I’m being torn in 8 different directions and soon all that’ll be left is chunks of fabric and exploded fluff.

I can feel the anger brimming, I know I’m going to explode.  I don’t want to go to sleep because the shock holding me back today will probably be replaced by agonising rage.

I’ve stopped feeling anxious all the time, it’s just grey.

I don’t want a label saying I’m crazy and I don’t care if I have a killer lump in me.  But I do care that the third person this year I’ve been either in or building a relationship with has cheated on me.  I also care that my grandad could have easily lived another few years if the hospitals weren’t flooded by covid cases from the unvaccinated, or if he’d been able to receive consistent professional advice on how to look after himself.  He was starved.  He died because of a gluten intolerance.  I know whose head it’s on and I know soon I’ll be beyond angry with them.

Doesn’t help I didn’t get to say bye.  Hadn’t seen him in weeks, I suppose it’s better to remember him in good shape rather than the wasted and starved body he probably had this morning."

MentalHealthUK,11/07/21 19:08:31,An app for mental health professionals,"Hi all,

I have made an app called Capture, the link for which is at the bottom of this post. This is an app specifically made for mental health professionals who have an independent practice. The app helps you to track your client's therapy. All the information is stored in the phone and not on any server. So, the app works without internet.

The app is capable of doing the following:

1. Record case history, identifying data and follow ups.

2. Track session payments. You, as a mental health professional, can track the payments made by your clients in any currency and mark them as paid, to be paid or free.

3. View information such as case history, follow ups, identifying data and session payments in a single screen.

4. Screenshots are disabled within the app. 

5. Quickly call/message the client.

6. Send/save case history as a password protected PDF. A password is required to generate and view the PDF. This password is used to encrypt the PDF. 

7. The app is now available in English, French and Bahasa (Indonesian). German and Filipino translations on the way.

I hope you find this useful. Please feel free to reach out to me for any suggestions/feedback. The app is available on Google playstore at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdr.capture"
MentalHealthUK,11/07/21 15:15:31,Conservative Family against a family member’s yoga and meditation routine,"My family are conservative Christians and they are against yoga and meditation. They said it prays to other spirits and it’s satanic. As a mental health professional and MSW research student doing her thesis on the Community Resiliency Model an evidenced based informed practice. I am an advocate for wellness tools and self-care. Research has been proven meditation has helped various individuals physically, physiologically, and psychologically. I provide education to my family but I find it difficult to discuss with them on how it is just a wellness exercise that won’t replace someone’s religious identity. I also had a panic attack when I had covid19 and meditation helped me reduce my stress. In addition, I don’t consider myself religious and they are unaware of my spiritual beliefs. What would you recommend saying to your family if you were in my situation?"

So I went outside fuming and did self harm. Went back to receptionist and said I burned myself so I wanna see someone else.

He said you can go out and keep burning yourself we can't help you its your choice.

Unfortunately I have continued to self harm with litt cigarettes over 8 times.

MentalHealthUK,11/07/21 03:43:31,I'm so lonely,"My mental health has once again led to the breakdown of a relationship, with my now-ex saying he's ""not interested"" when I tried to talk to him about my depression getting worse again.

He's not actually spoken to me, but he packed all his things and changed his relationship status to single on social media so I'm guessing we've broken up. I guess he doesn't respect me enough to actually talk to me though.

I just don't get what I do so wrong in this world and why people hate me so much. What do I do so wrong for people to not care about me and treat me like this?

My friends don't care. They either think I'm fine because I'm very blasé and have a good sense of humour, or they have the general attitude of ""aw that sucks but how does that affect me?"". I've even been asked in the past by my friends to show them death certificates when all my grandparents died within 6 months of each other because they didn't believe me.

Why am I always having to prove myself? Why do people not acknowledge me? What have I done so wrong? Why does no one care?

I have spent so much time on the phone to Samaritans lately, talking me out of situations and talking me for hours until I have calmed down. Maybe I'm just an awful person and everyone is right to not like me.

I am so lonely :("
MentalHealthUK,11/07/21 01:15:16,Slightly worried,"So, as most of may or may not know, I finally start my treatment this month! I made a post on it about a week or two ago.

I don't want to take forever explaining why I'm currently worried. I'll try to make it really short and to the point. 

Nearly two years ago I discovered an autism inpatient unit. A few months later after discovering the unit, I got impatient and impulsive and decided to email a psychiatrist that works at the unit. He also included one of the managers of the mental health team I'm currently under in the email. The psychiatrist from the autism unit said I'd have to do treatment at my local mental health team first. If that doesn't work, then maybe a referral to the autism unit. So, since December 2020 (when I emailed the psychiatrist) to about April 2021, I was trying to get my treatment forwarded. After fighting so damn hard, it got forwarded to November 2021. I have yet to start it, but hopefully I'll get a date next week.

Anyway, I'm worried about getting the treatment done at my local CMHT and if it genuinely doesn't work for me, the psychiatrist might think that I've purposely said it hasn't worked so then I can get a referral to the autism unit. Of course I want the treatment to work, but what if it works and then a  few years later I have a mental health relapse? When I've had relapses in the past, it's been really bad and I was once nearly borderline psychotic - it was as scary as anything and I tried to use CBT, etc. Nothing worked for me. I started believing things that weren't true, etc.

I'm just worried, you know? What if they think I'm overexaggerating?"
MentalHealthUK,11/07/21 00:14:55,I took a week off work and I dread going back on Monday,"I love my job and I'm still working remotely, which is great but I'm working with about half a dozen managers and other colleagues in multiple offices and have been feeling overwhelmed the past few months.  Things have been very busy (for everyone) and I've been working a lot of 12-14 hour days.  I know that there's going to be a lot waiting for me when I start back on Monday.

I've made real strides with improving my mental health over the past week, some days eating 3 meals a day which I haven't done since June, reduced OCD and skin picking and some improvements in my agoraphobia (I spent long enough in the kitchen to clean out the fridge for the first time in a year).  I'm waiting for a referral from my GP for the mental health services, and a referral from occupational health from my work.  Amy advice on avoiding backsliding would be welcome."
MentalHealthUK,11/06/21 22:47:33,Rule change info following the closing of the poll,"Hey there everyone, following the poll there has now been a rule change. 

[Just over double](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/qlw1pk/requiring_sub_feedback_comments_on_this_aspect_or/) the amount of people voted for some kind of change rather than to keep things as they are, which is enough of a margin to act upon in the interest of the sub. 

Vlogs/blogs/relevant external personal content can now only be posted on the **first and last day of each month** - this was taking into consideration that 15 people voted for none of that content to be posted here at all, though was not the most popular option so a noticeable but not complete reduction seems a good balance.

However, **exceptions can be made between these two days** such as if it's content that covers a current relevant news story, relevant ongoing issue within the mental health community/services e.g SIM, if it's exceptionally informative or covers a relevant event which would take place within the first and last day of each month. 

**This frequency also applies to posting of external unofficial groups and relevant business ventures, but posting of those now requires mod approval first.** 

Research can still be promoted on behalf of somewhere such as a University or charity at any time, but consider waiting a day or two if several have already been posted that day.

Original personal creative content such as a song, poem, drawing etc that isn't linked to aj external site can still be posted any time, if it's not been posted on more than 1 or 2 other subs. 

If this rule is ignored then it may result in being removed without explanation (depending on my energy levels) or being shadowbanned if it happens several times - **if you're unsure if something is suitable then feel free to send a modmail first!**"

Would they do things to reassure them they won't be chucked out or something?

I have generalised anxiety so maybe that's the only reason for it.

Tonight was awful but thankfully they've stopped now. I know there's going to be more fireworks at the weekend though. The past few weeks have been awful just hearing fireworks every night, yesterday they were still going off at midnight and the other day they were setting them off during daylight :( I really hate it here and I can't imagine what it's like for those which loud noises trigger flashbacks."

MentalHealthUK,11/06/21 04:54:10,Got detained under S136 and sent home after the MHA assessment,"Potential TW

Some background info: I’m a 19yo/F with diagnosis of bpd, autism, depression, social anxiety and struggle with chronic suicidal thoughts. Currently under adult mental health services and was with CAMHS for 6 years prior

I’m feeling so hopeless, this Wednesday I attempted to do something to end my life and was unsuccessful, my mum called the police and they ended up detaining me under a section 136. I tried to escape from the police twice, the first time I was restrained and held against their car, handcuffed and searched. The second time was forced on the ground and restrained by 3 police officers until I stopped struggling, then taken to a 136 suite in handcuffs. It was so distressing and I am covered in bruises from being restrained so aggressively. 

I had a mental health act assessment a couple hours later and felt the psychiatrists and AMHP didn’t care at all. They decided not to detain me and I went home the same day and have since attempted to harm myself in the same way. Adult services know this but don’t seem to care or act on anything, all I am told is that sectioning is the last resort, I don’t meet the criteria, I’m deemed to have capacity etc. My care coordinator said that I have never made a serious suicide attempt and have been saying I want to kill myself for six years, like if I was genuinely suicidal I should’ve done it by now. It feels like I need to almost die for mental health services to help me. They don’t even believe I’m genuinely suicidal and I feel worthless because no one cares that I attempted suicide. 

They suggested an informal admission to hospital but I don’t know if I want that, I know the hospital environment is terrible and I don’t think I can go voluntarily or commit to staying there. I have been so depressed for months and this is the worst it’s ever been everyday I get distressed and hurt myself and I feel unable to help myself at this point, all I want is to die and I feel unable to accept help. I don’t think I even want to get better I just want to be dead now. I wish that someone else would make choices for me and my plan is to continue harming myself until I’m either sectioned or die. 

The psychiatrists said if I don’t start making choices then there’s no point in mental health services involvement but I don’t know what to do. I’m so stuck and they’re just going to leave me. 

I have no faith in mental health services because they don’t care, it’s like my life is worthless and no matter how much I’m struggling I never deserve help. 

I live with my parents and my mum is an alcoholic who is emotionally and financially abusive towards me also, my whole family are tired of my mental health and it’s affecting them. I just can’t cope and things are getting worse quickly and I feel it’s only a matter of time till I ended up being 136’d or in hospital again"

Sorry if this isn't appropriate for this group!


I'm nearly 37, male and live in a small coastal town in North Somerset. At one point I had an active social life, but it's non-existence now through not being friends with a nasty woman and other factors. The only people I see on a regular basis is my own family and a neighbour who I see once or twice a month. On Facebook I put would anyone local I know want to meet up for a coffee. Not one response. Considering this is a small town, it's odd how you can lose touch. I'd understand Birmingham or London, but not here!

The thing is, my life is just helping my family either sorting out their ongoing housing issues or picking up my nephew from school once or twice a week in the neighbouring village my sister lives in. Adding to that, I'm gay but I am not into the gay scene or Drag Race. I'm more your football fanatic, laddish type. Plus I'm not into an agenda (my views are fairly average). I did do some voluntary work but that ended due to Covid and probably won't return ever again. Adding to that, I want a partner as I've been single for seven years due to my ex's death. The standard on the  dating apps is low to non existent in my town and the city that neighbours us. I feel lonely. What do I do?"

MentalHealthUK,11/03/21 02:32:18,Nothing will take my crippling anxiety away.,"I can barely go outside anymore, and even struggle leaving my bed or watching TV because its too overwhelming.


My head is stuck in analysis paralysis I've found out, and I can't get out of it. My mind will think of a million reasons why something could go wrong and all the different possibilities it's overwhelms me almost 24/7. I have stomach pain related to this anxiety all the time and this also makes things worse, I often throw up before doing simple things. I can't eat, I can just about sleep. 


I used to be quite impulsive, but I managed to stop doing impulsive things but now I feel like I've gone the other way and can't make any decision because I'm not sure if it's 'best for me'.


I've read self help guides, used meditation and breathing, and distress tolerance techniques, but it just feels like it's getting worse and worse. It's really straining my relationships especially as my boyfriend is essentially my carer now and is dealing with his own shit. Fluoxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, propananol and chlorpromazine haven't helped a single bit. Even when I've tried diazepam with friends, I've felt extremely anxious while they were all chill and fucked up.


I know I need therapy desperately to sort out my dreadful thought processes but I've been on the waiting list for nearly 2 years now, so I guess I will just have to wait. I wish I could afford private therapy, but I really can't especially as some of my worries are financial related. I have a diagnosis of BPD and several suicide attempts in the past so I'm usually ruled out of the low intensity therapies even run by charities.



I guess I'm just asking if anyone has experienced anything similar or any advice to get out of this horrid cycle? I don't really have any support other than my GP and friends and it's beyond hard."

If you have a few minutes to spare, please consider signing this petition, it can be done anonymously:[ https://chng.it/5GM9HHXzqX](https://chng.it/5GM9HHXzqX)

In the UK, Health Care Assistants (HCA's) are the primary carers of patients on psychiatric units. They make up the majority of staffing on units in the UK and they interact with patients suffering from depression, schizophrenia, BPD, and trauma more closely and frequently than any other type of staff member, yet, currently, they are not required to have mental health training.

This issue has effected me personally and it has been sickening to read the stories being gathered by this charity from those who are most vulnerable have suffered at the hands of people tasked with providing the empathy and care they so desperately need."
MentalHealthUK,11/01/21 13:20:40,How much of mental illness is actually due to capitalism?,"Psychopathologies like depression, paranoia, borderline personality, as well as the symptoms  like hallucination, delusion, splitting, etc. are promoted by a culture which alienates groups and incentivises individual self-interest.

Psychoanalysis focuses on what's wrong within the psyche of the individual while Marxian critique looks at the systemic dimensions of alienation and the suffering it causes. What are your thoughts?"

I've now started a new job and I enjoy the work and my colleagues are so lovely and amazing and it's now that I'm experiencing worry, anxiety, I'm more nervous than I've ever been and experiencing what I believe is depression, I think I'm finding it harder to deal with because I should feel in a good place. I was out of work for quite a while before getting my new job so I think I just need to get used to working full time again, especially in an office environment. I've been advised by my work to talk to the doctors or even some charities that may be able to help, but I thought I'd come here first (which may seem strange to some people) looking for coping mechanisms, even just to talk it out with people in a similar position or people that have experienced the same sort of things.

Im currently with Psychiatry UK via NHS right to choose for ADHD and started medication but I feel like i urgently need to be tested for autism too. 
I was wondering if anyone had experience with them for something else than ADHD, even as private. Can they really do a formal official diagnosis of ASD (ASC like they say) ?
Of course i could ask them directly and during my adhd assessment they said the plan is to treat ADHD and then they see if more work needs to be done on other stuffs but i just want to hear from other ppl. All i can find about PUK on reddit is ADHD stuffs.
Im a bit concerned because when during my adhd assessment i mentioned thinking i could be autistic too my psychiatrist was almost saying its not likely just because i always had lot of friends.
Thx"

MentalHealthUK,10/30/21 04:54:31,Rant/Mental Health Services/Campaigns,Basically impossible to get help in this country.

MentalHealthUK,10/29/21 22:36:38,Mental Health Support for Parents.,"Hello there. I'm glad I've found this group. As a long term mental health sufferer myself who for the time being seems to have found some peace in the constant day to day battle that is depression and anxiety in my life I'm glad to see such a supportive and informative community exist. 

I'm writing in the group not for myself but for my father (not on his behalf). He has been suffering from mental health for as long as I could remember. He grew very impoverished with poor family dynamics. Moved from his home country with very little and built himself up but of course, a lot of those experiences have stayed with him which I can only speculate might be some of the roots of the causes. When we were younger although his condition was noticeable he was always able to push through it with the sheer need to provide for my family and get our lives to a better place than he had. Now I fear he's losing more control than he usually had. He turned 60 and it's sad to see someone I always saw as one of the pillars of the family (next to my mother) start to deteriorate. He has no interests anymore, doesn't spend much time outside of the house and work, he's developed unhealthy eating habits which to be fair he's had since I was young to deal with his anxiety, he's constantly erratic, restless and doesn't sleep much. He's a very open man and has spoken freely about his problems, understands some causes but I feel his inability to apply anything practical in regards to helping himself is starting to cause a negative effect for him and others around him. 

I want to help!  I'm near my 30's, far from wealthy, but my family and I would do anything in regards to resources, time and attention to facilitate a path where he can try to find coping mechanisms even at this age. We're based in London but he's a tech-savvy man so he's able to do things online also. 

Has anyone dealt with their parent's mental health issues before? As much as I speak to him about getting help there is always going to be that parent &amp; child dynamic of authority. I believe he's open but he's tried one through the NHS and unfortunately, it got cut short, since then he's become very sceptical about what it can do for him. He's beginning to believe he needs hynotheraphy. 

If anyone has dealt with this scenario before I'd love to hear your experience and alternatively If can recommend some good private practitioners who may be able to help him that would be also much obliged. I apologise if the above is a scrambled mess, it's very strange to have to write about my old man in this fashion. 

Thanks in advance."

MentalHealthUK,10/29/21 18:38:50,feeling of impending doom,"hi all

i had a very traumatic two years, with also some trauma in my younger years. i died briefly last year, was in the ICU and came close to losing everything and being referred to a homeless hostel. social/MH services were absolutely appalling and i was put through the mill and lucky to come out the other side. very luckily i'm housed now but i have experienced so many issues with housing it's like i can't feel safe or rest. i miss the house i grew up in (my parents lost their house due to money problems which came from living beyond their means) and when i was working and able to rent somewhere. i have worked hard since i was 16 but always either housing, physical health or mental health problems (usually all connected and influencing each other in ways) landed me unable to work or have a place to live . yes i am housed now and i know i am incredibly lucky to be considering the current housing crisis. that makes me very scared for the future and every time i try to come up with a plan of action (retrain, find work) getting some security seems unattainable and i stay in the freeze response. it just doesn't seem possible considering when i worked 40-50 hours i was barely been able to afford rent and it did me in. when i tried to study the university culture made me very ill. i keep getting these horrible pangs of panic and anxiety and also feeling very angry at people around me that are living in nice areas or buying their homes. i think it is processing the trauma and i need help with that but i have no faith in the mental health system due to experiences i have had. they won't treat me for trauma and just label me EUPD which makes me feel powerless and angry. i just want to be able to feel safe again but everything around me seems so scary, dangerous and just about impossible."

MentalHealthUK,10/29/21 06:38:59,"Desperate for a different medication, but my doctor’s say they can’t prescribe it.","History:
I went on mirtazapine as a teen and it destroyed me. Completely. It got me out of bed enough to not fail my exams but not for anything else until I came off it. 

I went unmedicated for years until my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I gave sertraline a try. Destroyed my sex drive, made me gain a lot of weight. Switched to citalopram and it got worse so I came off it. 

My mom passed at the start of lockdown last year and I’ve been so much worse since. Because of the pandemic I didn’t want to bother anyone with it, but I’ve been worse. Weight gain is a huge trigger for me. I won’t take medication that will make me worse. 

So for that reason I wanted to try Bupropion, I heard way better things about it. 

I finally got through to my doctor today and he told me my only choices were the SSRIs I’d had before or two others that are guaranteed weight gain. 

On the phone he asked me if I had suicidal thoughts recently and asked me to tell him how I tried to kill myself previously and told me they just can’t prescribe it and my only option is to basically say I’m about to kill myself, and be referred to the mental health team who might prescribe it to me. 

I can’t do that to myself. I just want to be healthy without putting myself through extreme stress again or abusing the system. Are there *any* other possible ways to get this prescription?"
MentalHealthUK,10/29/21 05:54:36,I feel like nothing can help me at this point.,"I’m extremely frustrated with everything right now.

I’ve got GAD, Depression, OCD, Chronic Dpdr and an eating phobia. I was in the hospital for 6 hours yesterday because I’ve lost more weight and was experiencing heart palpitations. Currently weight 105lbs at 6’0.

The hospital done some tests and sent me home saying they’ll ‘draw up a plan’ but I’ve heard it all before a year ago. Nothing happened.

It’s just keeps getting worse despite the fact I’ve tried CBT multiple times (although I got passed around for months after waiting for 6 months). It didn’t help in fact it made me worse.

I’ve seen multiple private psychologists and they’ve not really helped, feel like I’ve wasted the thousands of pounds I’ve spent on them.

My doctor still refuses to send me to a gastro even though I’m having stomach issues and can barely eat.

I can’t exercise or go out because I feel too weak. Recently got diagnosed with osteoporosis so my body is suffering. I’m off sick from work again. It’s been a lifetime of mental illness and things just keep getting worse.

Also tried Sertraline for one day but it made me even more suicidal due to the increase in anxiety which is already through the roof. I don’t think it was the pill itself I was mainly concerned about side affects and how I’d be screwed if I needed urgent help because the mental health system is crap.

My family or friends don’t understand and normally shout at me or blame me for my issues.

I feel like I’m one of the ones who don’t make it. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve called the Samaritans just to talk to somebody who can at least pretend to care."

I'm frustrated to say the least, it was the perfect role due to the area and being within the existing organisation. 

I know I am worth more than I am currently being paid, the only thing stopping me from going for a new job is the crippling anxiety around moving companies.

MentalHealthUK,10/28/21 19:26:50,Mental health team won't give me letter for PIP because I missed some appointments due to having a stroke.," A few weeks ago I made this post, about how I was on PIP for thyroid cancer treatment and depression (already made one suicide attempt, spent 5 days in intensive care). Then I had a stroke, which has left me partially sighted, and after applying for an increase in PIP, my PIP was stopped altogether.

[I've lost £3000 because of a Tory MP and he just does not care. : GreenAndPleasant (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenAndPleasant/comments/q6k68p/ive_lost_3000_because_of_a_tory_mp_and_he_just/)

I was so overwhelmed and ready to give up, but a very kind redditor who is a law student contacted me and she's been helping me with appealing. After pressure from her, Kevin Foster's office got a little bit involved and have got the DWP to escalate my case. The thing is, they say I have to resubmit all the medical evidence. Now the mental health team are being really difficult about it.

This time around, I was on the waiting list for my depression from 2018. In 2020 I finally got three sessions of CBT (which was useless and stupid) then everything got shut down because of lockdown. Then I was diagnosed with the stroke, I was feeling very unwell and had endless hospital appointments for that. I also had loads of appointments at the eye clinic because I lost a quarter of my vision in the stroke - literally every single day for a while and was often there all day long. After everything opened back up again, the mental health team offered me appointments again. I explained the stroke situation, and the fact that I was feeling unwell and had a lot of hospital appointments already, and asked to take a break from the CBT for a while.

There is a really high turnover of staff at the mental health place (the Chadwell Centre - read their reviews online, they're bad) and every time I see anyone there or get contacted by anyone, it's always someone new who doesn't know me at all, and apparently hasn't read the emails I've sent to the previous people. So I contacted them and asked for a letter detailing my condition and how it affects me for PIP, and I got a very unpleasant email back from a new woman who has never dealt with me before and apparently didn't know why I hadn't attended appointments for a few months. She acted like I just couldn't be bothered to come to appointments and she won't write me a letter for PIP and implied I have nobody to blame but myself. I explained about the stroke and needing to take a break but she still won't help. I explained that without PIP I can't survive and I don't see any way out of this financial situation except suicide. I said that I understand if they need to see me face to face to talk about it, since they are new people and don't know me, I will come if I have to even though I feel unwell and stressed out. Or alternatively they could just print out a copy of the last letter of support that a mental health worker who actually knew me wrote last time. But she said she can't do any of that.

Now the law student from reddit is helping with this too. But I just need to vent about it and I want everyone to know how the mental health service treats stroke and cancer patients with suicidal depression. How they are punishing me for being to ill to attend mental health appointments for a while.

My PIP was stopped in July, so I've lost £720 so far, I'm losing £240 a month. My financial situation is now so bad that I'm in an overdraft, and have been desperately looking through my room for anything I could sell. The only thing I have are a few pairs of trainers which I have advertised on ebay, vinted, shpock and gumtree, but no takers so far. I have nothing else worth anything, my clothes are all cheap and tatty and apart from an ancient CD player from the 1990s and a few old CDs I don't own anything.

Why does everything have to be so difficult, all the time?

This is in England."

MentalHealthUK,10/27/21 18:18:40,I can’t do this anymore.,"Don’t post this anywhere else please. 

Trigger warning- Abuse and SH mentioned. 

The last few years have been utter shit I won’t lie. Three years ago I was sexually and emotionally abused. I reported it but u it I was handled horribly by the police and it never went any further. I never got help because I was made to feel (by the police) like it wasn’t a big deal. I then shared a class with said person for the next few years. 

In that time I was suicidal, self harming and severely depressed and anxious. I got a bit better but it never really went away. Then in 2020 I went to college. It’s a dance college so I already work my body to the limits. But my teacher is awful and borders on emotionally abusive. I hate the place and every day I am scared to go in. I love dance and in a few months I have auditions for dance universities. I need my tutor to get to an audition ready place. 

Then this year I am done. The pandemic ruined me. I’m still severely depressed and anxious. Since I was 13 years old I have seen so many people who tired to help me mentally but lost if the time they saw me for one session and that was it. Then in December 2019 I finally found someone who I clicked with and they were helping. Then in February they disappeared off the face of the earth and they referred me to another mental health service. 

Then a month ago I had an assessment for this service where I disclosed my past trauma. A week later I had a social worker at my door who I had to recount this to who then told me the police would have to get involved again, against my will. I then had to recount my story to a police officer who then gave me TWO DAYS to decide if I wanted to prosecute. I’m 17, I felt like that was way too little time. After that I was a wreck, I felt physically sick and anxious and I wasn’t in college. I found it it’s a 6/9 month waiting list until I can get help from the mental health service and it’s going to be a while until I can get help from specially trained SA counsellors. 

Then to top it all off we’re getting our kitchen redone and it’s all gone tits up. We’ve had no kitchen for three months so we can’t really cook anything and we have no tap except out bathroom one. My gran got diagnosed with cancer and both of my sisters have had covid and had both been around my gran. And now my younger sister has got it to keep everyone safe my family isn’t even living together. 

It’s all small things but I’ve had enough. I have two jobs and I’m so stressed with college and everything else happening in my life. I have virtually no help from anyone to help me deal with anything (my family and boyfriend are great support systems but there’s only so much they can do). I’ve tried using crisis lines but they don’t really help. 

I am done. It genuinely feels like there is no way out of this right now and I can’t cope anymore. 

I don’t know if this is a rant or me asking for advice but any words right now would be nice."

I've had therapy in the past - both through the NHS and via my private health insurance through work. But they both give you a set number of sessions, and every time I've done it it's been of questionable value since it just feels like we're rushing through things to try and get an outcome by session 10 or whatever. I feel like I could use something a bit slower paced, where there's time to dive deep into all of my issues without worrying about going over my quota.

Basically, I need a route into an open-ended relationship with a therapist, but I want to make sure that I'm not being stupid and wasting my private benefits and spending tons of money on something that I could have gotten for free and/or isn't going to be all that much more beneficial.

The other night it hit me that I have very few people in my life who understand this condition and I figured if I were to reach out, perhaps I would attract a few people whom are interested in chatting and feel less alone in all of this. So, for background info, I have suffered from social anxiety since I was around 12 years old, it all stemmed from being bullied by my so called friends and then peers. I have never really had a close friend, hence me searching on here numerous times. Before the bullying happened, I was quite an outgoing child and spoke to people without hesitation which makes me question whether I am introverted by nature as social anxiety seems to have taken over my entire personality, such words like ''introvert'', ''homebody'' etc seem to fit perfectly but it does make me wonder how different I would be without feeling this way."

MentalHealthUK,10/26/21 21:13:13,Why are my memories so blurry?,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I don't know where else to put it.

I was looking at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/qg0eit/whats_the_first_big_news_event_that_you_remember/) thread in /r/AskUK and looking for people born around the same time as me (2001). Several people born around then remembered Maddy McCann going missing, several remembered the 2011 riots, some people even remembered the 2005 London bombings, and it kinda struck me that I don't remember ANY of that. I would've just turned 10 when the London riots were happening, so why don't I remember?

I don't remember much of my primary school or early high school days either. There's a few odd memories that stick out? But apart from that it's all a blur, and all of my memories are like that. I don't understand why I don't remember. If I had to put a date on when I can actually clearly recall stuff, it would probably be when I was 15 or 16, because I clearly remember the Brexit vote. Is this something to be concerned about?"
MentalHealthUK,10/26/21 20:08:10,I don't know if CBT is helping and I might be autistic but I'm scared to get tested,"I just remembered that this is either my 5th or 6th time doing CBT. Granted this is the first time it's trauma CBT but it makes me question if this will actually do anything. Like it's never helped before so why would it do anything this time. We're almost done with the 20 sessions (should be getting another 20 session added on soon) and we haven't even started to cover the trauma because I'm not ready yet. Also I heard that CBT usually doesn't work for autistic people unless it's been specially adapted and I'm not diagnosed but I've been thinking about getting tested for autism.

If I try getting tested for autism I'm afraid they will take my therapist away and I really trust her and get on well with her and also I don't want to lose this therapy in the chance that it does help (plus some therapy is better than no therapy). But then if I am autistic and I don't get diagnosed then maybe I'll be in therapy for ages and not get better at all.

This past week I've also started having intrusive thoughts about not taking my medication which is just a nice added bonus. I know that stopping taking my medication will be disastrous because it accidentally happened last year but my brain keeps making me think about doing it anyway."

I get the beginning part but the end? I mean your body is falling apart and all your friends and family are dead. But you are happy?

MentalHealthUK,10/26/21 05:14:45,Pregnancy is destroying me,"This may be triggering to some so there is mention of abortion and pregnancy. Please delete if not allowed, I just needed to try. 

I'm very early in pregnancy and ever since the finding out (a couple of weeks ago) this has not been a happy occasion for me. I was very fragile before finding out and in recovery with my mental health so this was a huge step back for me. Im clinging on and trying my hardest not to let this affect me as much as it will, but it's becoming harder by the day. If it wasn't for my partner who has been so extremely supportive throughout this, I genuinely don't think I would have managed.

To make matters worse, I have severe morning sickness to the point where drinking water even makes me want to be sick. I cannot enjoy food or my life anymore. I have lost weight and I don't even feel like a person. The doctors won't help me and I just want to make sure I am okay to go through with a termination by having a simple scan which they said I can have at...12 weeks. I specified I don't want to go through with the pregnancy and was told ""congratulations"" this morning while almost vomiting on a piece of fruit. I have to pay for an ultrasound now to check my health and confirm how far along I am so things go smoothly. My fear of having an abortion has turned to a desperate cry for help and need to be myself again. My parents don't know, my family doesn't know, my friends don't know - nobody has any idea. Im going to work almost passing the hell out from dizziness and nausea and I just can't cope. I want to scream to everyone that I'm pregnant. I just can't believe this is happening to me.

MentalHealthUK,10/26/21 03:46:03,Taking a break from work - any advice or suggestions to consider?,"Firstly - I’m not entirely sure if this is the right place to post but I struggled to find another sub that was relevant. 

I (29F) have struggled with my mental health (depression, anxiety and most recently diagnosed with C-PTSD) for around 10 years now. I’ve been in and out on counselling, have been on anti-depressants, tried CBT, tried to change my lifestyle etc however the one constant outlet I had was my work however over the past 2 years (before the pandemic) this outlet started to shift into another stress and I no longer can use work as a way to cope with my mental health. 

Over the last few months, my physical health has really suffered which has never been an issue before and naturally has had an impact on my overall mental health. 

For the first time I am considering asking my doctor to sign me off for a few weeks but I’m not sure how to go about this as I’ve managed to cope for so long I feel like a fraud. I just wanted to know if anyone had any advice or suggestions on potentially taking time away from work? I appreciate every company has their own policies etc but I’m hoping I can ascertain some similarities and make a decision on whether this is the right step for me. 

TLDR: Mental health has been poor for 10+ years and now want to take a break for the first time from work and need advice."
MentalHealthUK,10/26/21 02:29:20,GP phone call tomorrow. Not sure how honest to be...,"I've no idea if I actually want support or just need to vent.  I'm also aware this may be triggering for some so feel free to just delete or ignore...  


I've got a medication review tomorrow and I'm absolutely dreading it, to such an extent I've returned to SH after 12 days clean. I'm not sure why or what to do about it though.   


I'm not planning on mentioning today's slip, but I'm worried that if I say I'm nearly two weeks clean he's going to ask what's different. The truth is, the only thing that's changed since I last spoke to my GP is that I've become emotionally numb after realising that there is only one way that things will ever change in my life,  and that's by changing my life status. Because I'm numb I don't have any need to SH, but whilst I'm perfectly at peace with the decision I've made, that doesn't mean I necessarily want to explain it to my GP.  


Which leads me to my main problem, and the one that's causing all the stress. How do I answer when he asks if I'm suicidal? Obviously I am,  but I'm not planning on doing anything right now as I need to get a will in place first and that takes time.  I'm not comfortable with lying and saying an outright no, but at the same time I don't want to sound melodramatic and say yes, when I know it won't be for a couple of months.  


The only alternative I can think of is just cancelling the appointment and stopping my medication cold-turkey. (I want to be sure that it is me making the decision and not the mirtazapine.) That's actually my preferred choice,  but despite how it sounds here I am trying to be responsible by discussing it with him first, and I know avoidance isn't really the answer. 


Like I say.  I'm not sure why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just hoping that writing it out will help me to get it straight before tomorrow. Although the way I'm agonising between flairs suggests I might need something more to straighten my head this evening!"
MentalHealthUK,10/26/21 00:43:55,Trying to get an assessment for ADHD - should I even try with the NHS or go private?,"Hi all. I'm currently trying to get assessed for ADHD - I've been struggling for the past decade or so but it's gotten so much worse recently. I'm seriously considering dropping out of my PhD if I cannot get help. I guess my question is if I should even bother to discuss this with my GP? I've heard horror stories about years-long ques and I don't think I can't wait that long. Added onto that I'm nearly 30 and I know it's very difficult to diagnose in adults. I also don't know if this relevant, but I've been diagnosed with OCD (was diagnosed nearly 3 years ago and am recieving CBT via the NHS for it). 

If I go private, would they still be able to keep in touch with my GP? I don't think I can afford much beyond the initial assessment and a few counselling sessions afterwards (that is, if I'm even diagnosed at that), and I definately won't be able to afford medication if it comes to it. Is there someway to bridge private with the NHS in this regard? Any help/advice will be appreciated!"
MentalHealthUK,10/25/21 23:27:55,Need to Change Meds bust afraid to talk to GP,"I’ve been living in the UK for two years and have been on the same meds I was prescribed before I came here, and they just aren’t cutting it. My GP originally referred me to a mental health assessment through the NHS but they just sent a letter saying they thought my GP could handle me. 
I’ll spare the details but my old meds are just not controlling the most aggressive symptoms of my illness anymore. I want to try something else but I have two fears going to my GP about a change: 1) I don’t want to be put on Lithium, which seems to be a highly prescribed treatment here 2) I don’t want to be sectioned or something drastic if I confide about my state of mind. I know the second one is wild but I see so much of it on the internet it’s become a fear. Any advice? Should I just go for it?"

MentalHealthUK,10/25/21 19:13:08,So tired of the NHS.,"Hey I've been diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, as well as various other conditions that I won't mention because they've never been explained to me/seem to have been diagnosed without any care whatsoever.

I've had such a poor experience with the NHS mental health service that I feel deeply traumatised from my interactions with them. I feel very strongly that I've been wilfully neglected by some of the teams I've been under, I've been lied to, gaslighted, ignored, misinformed and denied access to healthcare that I was told I could have, for no discernable reason. 

I've complained- they respond always with a blanket dismissal which is full of lies.
I've tried to report it to the police- they just tell me that it's not a crime and to go away.
I've written to my MP twice- who does nothing.
I've tried to raise it with the team I was under- they told me I need to forget about it and move on.
I've tried to tell anyone in a position of power- (private professionals, charity workers from mind and others, CQC) they just throw their hands up in the air.

I recognise that I'm one of the lucky ones. I can articulate my problems, I can still  keep my head above water and I can get financial support to just about afford a private course of therapy. 

Despite all this I am utterly miserable and totally crushed by the machinery of the mental health service. I have vague thoughts sometimes of what it must be like to be more severely ill, I realise that I'm dangling above a black hole. It's terrifying.

How did this happen? Was there ever a time when people were given options, dignity, basic care? I hear the phrases about underfunding and austerity but there doesn't seem to be a point in the past 11 years that I've been subjected to the system that I can point to and say- here is where things in my case gradually began to slope off, maybe this correlates to a national trend. It's always been appalling.

I'm trying to walk away, trying to heal. But I'm still so angry."

TW: SH Mentioned


So I am a 21 year old male from the UK. I’m suffering with severe mental health difficulties that are currently being seen to, to an extent. My sister is 11 years old and recently I found out she had self harmed after previously telling me about anxiousness in school. I reacted poorly at the time and took the knife from her while making her promise to never do it again, I even went as far as to insisting if she does do it she has to do it to me as well (Yes I know I’m a horrible person). I felt guilty and gave her back the knife and told her I trusted her and am here to support her if she will let me.

I feel terrible and I don’t know how to help. There’s nobody that I can speak to about this and the help she receives is relegated to what the school believes she “needs.”


I want to support her. She is my little sister. What do I do?"

The doctor (a psychologist) told me that the new trainee psychologists are having their introduction the first week of November, etc. So that means that I'll be seen very soon! I've waited nearly 2-years just to get any form of treatment and it's finally happening!

The doctor at my local CMHT decided to see me earlier due to my conditions being complex. I'm just so happy, and I haven't called the crisis team in a while either! IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING! :D

I just thought I'd share the news with you all - and remember - NEVER GIVE UP! It's easy to slip through the net when it comes to mental health treatment. You've got to fight your way through and get your voice heard!"

Ships in the night describe us pretty well, I haven't spent more than 5 minutes with my partner since covid started, opposite shifts at the same place allows us to say hi and bye as we swap the car over twice a day, even holidays haven't matched up enough to let us have time off together.
It's half term and we both have it off, I stayed up Friday night to welcome her home, the start of a fantastic week, but she didn't arrive, not till long after I fell asleep anyway, she claimed it was overtime, but a bit of pushing later and she broke down, she has been having an affair with 1 of our work colleagues, she would finish an hour early and they would drive to a layby somewhere, it's been going on for months.
I broke down, I finally made that call to a friend, I didn't want to admit I couldn't man up, so to speak, but I needed someone, my mates are on their way to me now, and dumping it on here has helped too, for the 1st time in a long time, I actually feel like there's a way forward.

Do I call NHS and ask for tests for each specific condition? Or is there a way to get tested for everything at once?

MentalHealthUK,10/23/21 05:29:25,I recently found out that I’m not the only one invalidated by CAMHS,"They are so against using the term “depressed” and choose “low mood” as a euphemism. It can feel very invalidating though. They’ll use the term “anxiety” fine though. Ive seen a few posts online about how their therapist told them they aren’t depressed because of how they dress and the fact they smiled ONCE during the appointment (an awkward smile, not one of happiness). How do they have degrees in mental health when they don’t know the basic fact that depression isn’t always visible?? I truly think they only diagnose those with severe depression to the point where you can’t leave your bed. I’m lucky I even got my OCD diagnosis because some of the therapists act like teens can’t be mentally ill and that it’s just normal behaviour. I hate to break it to you but self harm and suicidal thoughts/attempts aren’t just “low mood”. I was given a few questions on paper and even given antidepressants for my “low mood” but they never addressed the real issue. It’s not just CAMHS either, I’ve had a worse experience with hospital nurses. I was basically told my suicide woudlnt mayter by one nurse who was convinced I was attention seeking. She just loved to say thing that she knew would upset me: “if you were really that anxious you wouldn’t have been smiling earlier”, “there’s people with way worse OCD than you”. Okay, prove it! How about you live with this for just one day and let’s see you try to minimise it you actual cow.

I don’t know about you all but being invalidated by mental health “professionals” hurts more than being invalidated by regular people. Also, to be clear my whole CAMHS experience wasn’t awful. I know there’s a lot of horror stories but there are good therapists out there who work for the right reasons and will help, so try not to let this put you off going."

I have flashbacks that last anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. I have constant nightmares amongst over things.

MentalHealthUK,10/23/21 00:37:51,Any worthwhile psychiatrists in the UK?,"I've been battling debilitating anxiety over the last 5 years and have since spend thousands on private psychiatrists as seeing one on the NHS is next to impossible. Well, it has been a massively underwhelming experience so far. For how much I'm paying, and for what I get in return, I would have been better off burning that money to heat my house.

What I need is a doctor that is experienced in dealing with treatment resistant anxiety. Someone who is not set in their ways of just prescribing the 'normal' medication, and taking a stab in the dark as it were. 

I've tried so many different medications over the last few years, almost none of which have helped, and it's weeks of absolute agony going through the adjustment period every time just to find out it's not only not working, but making me feel far worse.

I need someone who thinks outside the box that has experience with prescribing off-label medication that works for someone in my position, and who's not afraid to try unconventional meds or 'old' medications that aren't widely used anymore, which might be beneficial.

I need someone who can look at my history and understand why the medications I've taken haven't worked, and come up with a plan to find something that does. I also need someone who is willing to let me suggest and try medications, within reason, that I think might help that they might not have thought of.

I need a doctor that's available when I need him/her. Not get back to me in a week saying I can't be seen for another 4 weeks.

I also need the doctor that will send my notes to my GP so they can prescribe any decided upon medication to me, rather than having to pay for private prescriptions.

I know this might seem like a lot to ask, but in my view, this is what every psychiatrist should be like. All the doctors I've worked with so far have been a massive let down to say the least. For the amount they charge, I would expect them to be excellent at finding a solution to help someone like me. Yet here I am 5 years later still no better off.

Are there any psychiatrists like that in the UK? Or do people like that not exist? Because I'm tired of paying someone hundreds of pounds every time I need to try a new medication, which then doesn't work. I might as well get hold of these medications myself and try them out, for free. I mean, why do I need a so called psychiatrist for that?"

I have been made redundant from my work during coronavirus, I have zero self confidence.

I'm sure I need to just get on with it, but mentally I am really struggling. I feel as though I need to be diagnosed with something, as there must be something massively wrong with me.

I have been reading stoic books, but this hasn't helped too much.

Unsure if it's because I am in the wrong career, mental health problems, some ailment like ADHD or hormone imbalances.

I'm very much struggling with adjusting to the working world, and I don't think I have the ability to do this for another 40+ years.

1) *Which mental health services have you accessed from the NHS in your life time?*  
What a minefield! This is gonna be a 'tick all that apply' question, which options do you feel are important to include here? 

2) *Which professionals in the NHS did you see before being diagnosed?*  
Another 'select all that applies' question. Current options are: GP, mental heath nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, therapist. Are these too general? Am I missing an important role?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can share. It's still a work in progress but [the survey is here](https://forms.gle/Yeb9KpD8BJMDAYuXA) if anyone wants to take a closer look- all feedback is welcome and any submitted responses at this point will be deleted."
MentalHealthUK,10/22/21 19:11:35,What is wrong with me.,I don't know how to snap out of my depressive episodes. My life's like a roller coaster. I have a few good days but it always reverts back to me just not wanting to do anything. I can't go near people and only go out to go to the shop. I sit in my flat all day and just lie on the sofa. I know its making me worse but I can't help it. I want to do thing but when the opportunity comes I back out and hide. I get angry at the few people that want to help and push everyone away. I absolutely detest the human race and everything I see and everywhere I go there's negativity. I don't know how to get out of it.
MentalHealthUK,10/22/21 18:01:53,Migraine and Insomnia Research Involvement Opportunity,"The MISSION study (Migraine and Insomnia Study- Systematic Investigation of an ONline intervention) is a research project investigating digital sleep treatments for patients struggling with chronic migraines and insomnia. People with migraines often try to find a dark room and nap to find relief from a migraine, which can disrupt sleep at night. Sleep problems at night can then trigger a migraine the next day. This can become a viscous and distressing cycle between migraines and insomnia. We are hoping to test a treatment for insomnia to determine if it stops this cycle . 

We are interested in finding UK based individuals that experience migraines to join our steering meetings (two per year, travel costs and expenses covered) and be involved in the continued development and dissemination of the research through providing their lived experience insight.

MentalHealthUK,10/21/21 19:34:50,Saw a counsellor today and realised how truly messed up I was,"Two years ago I went through a period where all I thought about beyond sixth form was literally committing suicide.  I assumed everyone just thought about it everyday and whenever I filled in mental health questionnaires I obviously answered honestly and couldn’t fathom why the people who would follow up sounded so concerned.  I didn’t want to actually do it but the idea was constantly there.

I forgot about that feeling but recently went back to get help because everything has started falling apart but I don’t feel pain, just a numbness and when I spoke about how I felt two years ago I realised I hadn’t thought about suicide in nearly 6 months.  I realised how abnormal my thoughts were two years ago.  It was a weird feeling."
MentalHealthUK,10/21/21 17:27:50,Anxiety stops me from attending seminars I want to attend,"So I sometimes get very bad anxiety, especially going into a place that I’ve never been or a place that I know has a lot of people being quiet. I’m a second year, and due to the pandemic, my first bits of face to face learning started this year. 

I want to attend my seminars, I just don’t have the courage to do so. I always seem to psyche myself out, and then send the Professor and email saying ‘sorry I can’t attend I’ve got blah blah blah’. I know this can’t go on, I do all the prep for them and am ready to go the night before too.

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to cope with this? My main issue is that my stress leads to stomach issues and noises that largely prevent me from attending."
MentalHealthUK,10/21/21 13:19:55,Advice?,"Hey everyone. In this current time, this place feels one of the only places I can turn. I hope someone can give a perspective on what's happening and not call me crazy. TW mentions of r*pe and SA. 

Lately there has been so much happening that I feel I can't fix by just 'having a better mindset' or 'learning how to cope' - it's to the point of where I genuinely see no way out other than medication. (going to the doctors is a struggle for me for too many reasons at the moment)

I'm going to be open and honest here because it's mostly anonymous so if I get judged like most people in person, then no one can put the name to the face besides one person.

I'm going to go in order of what I find the least severe/scary, but that doesn't mean they don't bother me because heck.. THEY DO.

1) I keep feeling absent from my body:
Sometimes when I'm in class, or talking to someone, but especially when I get triggered, I feel myself just feeling disconnected from the world around me. When I try to focus, I can hear the words being said by the teacher, but my brain doesn't process them at all. A way of putting it, it's like my brain has ran out of storage so the information gets heard but not recognised. When I go into these stages my head hurts like hell, it feels like I'm slightly behind my whole body? So like, say the normal way we view the world is level 4, you see everything, process everything normally, but most importantly if you look at your hands you feel connected like they're your hands. But I'd say in these moments I feel at level 2. So, I can hear everything going on, I know I'm in my body, but I feel a few steps back from everything. As if I'm kinda watching it as another person but in first person? I hope this makes sense. I get so stressed in these moments because I'm doing a-levels (UK) so if you miss even 5 minutes of information, it can be pretty damaging to how you do in an exam. So the words just glaze over me when I want to listen. Oh and when people talk to me, I can't even understand basic sentences sometimes, and it feels absolutely horrible.

2) I keep having these very extreme moods that feel way too much to handle.

This used to happen when I was triggered (so if something connected to my traumatic past was brought up) but now it can happen because of something that angers or upsets me, or just because for no reason whatsoever. Usually, it's from pain. I go into this state where I feel really really high, and I mean mood high, but the cause is pain not happiness. My thoughts race faster than normal, and when I speak, I speak so quick, my mind lags behind in a sense. I hate this part so much, but, I lose my filter. So I say whatever comes to my mind without any thought, it all just comes out even if I don't wanna say it. I feel high on pain, so most people say my fast talking and way of speech makes me sound happier when I can never understand because I'm so pained. My body feels like electricity is travelling through it and it makes me want to do so many things. Like I have all the energy I don't know what to do with. In these moods, a common thing for me is to become a lot more impulsive than normal. I constantly get violent thoughts about hurting myself and some of them, I've been so close to acting out. Another common theme I've noticed, but not in all of these instances, I want to feel danger. Like I want to tightrope my roof, or lean out a car window, jump onto a motorway and dodge the cars. I hate it so much sometimes. Whatever emotion I'm feeling is heightened, and because I lose my filter, I feel so much guilt afterwards and then immediately get suicid*l because I feel I've been too much of a burden to people and hurt every person I've interacted purely because I was in that mood. Recently, I've also had moments where I've felt so low also that I felt no worth. And kept saying how I wanted to 'sell myself and let all the men use me for my purpose'. I don't believe for anyone else this is a womens purpose, in fact I advocate women having the choice and no matter how many or who with, should be supported and never forced. Women are more than just s*x machines. But for some reason I don't feel that for myself. In this moment I felt like if I did all of these sexual things, I'd become so numb that eventually I could no longer hurt, but my main thought was providing others with sexual favours to please them. Which scares me because being vulnerable is something I never wanna be, I hate the thought of s*x, hate it, I never want to engage in it. And this I guess 'hyper-sexual' part of me, scares the heck out of me. 



3) I keep hallucinating things?
This is a recent thing for about 3 ish weeks now? I keep hallucinating people touching me. Most of the time innapropiately. But sometimes not, and it doesn't actually feel like a touch, but my mind imagines it there. I have some trauma around being touched innapropiately so it could be that, but sometimes the hallucinations even go as far as feeling like I'm being r**ped (it didn't go that far with the actual experience, just a touch that made me uncomfortable in an area that they shouldn't have) . Sometimes I hear things like my name or noises, but that's not very often. And the name tends to be a mix between my deadname and the name Identify with. It's very scary, and when it happens, I can't help but want to curl into a ball and cry. But with this one, not many would believe me because they seem to think that I was never touched by an older man when I was younger. I think it's because I'm extremely patchy on the details, and only came to the realisation that it was basically SA years later when I remembered It (because I basically forgot about it and blocked it out I suppose), it was nearly 6 ish years ago now."

MentalHealthUK,10/21/21 05:24:35,Gp has suddenly taken my Mum off her medication.,"Went to visit my Mother today and she has informed me that her gp has taken her off her long time prescription of fluoxetine. She has been in talks with her GP for the last month or two as she's been going through abit of a rough patch. He has decided that the medication must be the problem and has chosen to completely remove her prescription cold turkey. Whilst stating ""Going for a walk could do wonders"" Whilst she waits to speak to a mental health doctor.

Abit of background, my Mother was diagnosed as Schizoaffective a number of years ago after suffering a complete mental breakdown, ending with her being sectioned for a number of months. Whilst she has had ups and downs since then I have always believed the medication helped keep her grounded and was the best thing for her, especially when the UK health system refuses to put her on any kind of long term counselling.

I am completely out of my depth here but feel like an injustice has been suffered  She has been put on urgent referral to a psychologist but that still means she has to wait til November to see anyone who actually understands Mental illness and her own specific medical history. I'm not sure what I am looking for here, I suppose I'd be interested in other people's experience in situations like this be it personal or someone close to you. I love my Mum and want nothing more than for her to be receiving the care she needs to prosper ( which she has been able to do post breakdown and medical intervention).

Thanks,"

MentalHealthUK,10/21/21 02:55:29,UK in-school mental health support,"hi :)
I have a call with CAMHS soon, and they’re talking about extending my support circle into school. I’m wondering if anybody has had their teachers informed of your mental health situation, for example, if you’re at risk of suicide are your teachers usually told about this? Do they tend to prevent telling your actual subject teachers and stick to keeping it in the school pastoral team only? 

Also this is completely unrelated, but if I were to tell my therapist about something that had happened a while ago, and I was no longer feeling the way I was during that time, would they still have to break confidentiality? Even if the situation is long in the past and no longer relevant? 

Any ideas would be appreciated &lt;3"
MentalHealthUK,10/21/21 01:44:53,My experience with the Dare app for panic and anxiety,"A while back when other people's posts were helping me, I made a mental note to return to this sub when I was feeling better to share some things that helped me. If people don't find it annoying, I might do a couple more of these posts. The point isn't to convince anyone to use the same resources, think the same as me, or anything like that — I simply want to share thoughts on things that have helped me and why, because this kind of peer recommendation is what led me to the things that made life with mental illness easier.

We're all different of course and there's no one size fits all, but if anyone's interested, here is my experience with the Dare app, which is based on the Dare book but can be used alone. The Dare app has both a paid and free version; I use the free one. 

When I first started experiencing panic and anxiety, I had no idea how to handle it. It was terrifying and upended my life, every minute of every day was near unbearable. At the time, I was doing CBT which is useful, but it didn't provide the relief I was looking for. Researching anxiety and panic, I kept coming across success stories and hypotheses about how learning to accept and allow anxiety was paradoxically one of the most effective ways of treating it. I quickly started to look for resources informed by ACT, and came across Dare.

The app is based on 'The DARE Response' — a method of working through anxiety that involves 4 key steps. It has different sections, but the 'Anxiety Relief' folder on the home page as well as the SOS tab have made more difference to my life than anything else. The SOS section contains audios that designed to help during the worst moments such as a panic attack. The Anxiety Relief' folder has introductory audios that tell you about Dare, and what it's based on. There's much more to explore, but these are what I used.

The Panic Attack audio in the SOS tab has transformed my relationship to panic. I used to have a panic attack about once a week, and every time I had one I would listen to this guided audio. It's not magic, and will not give you instant relief, but it guides you through techniques compassionately to alleviate some of the tension and help pull you through. Practicing acceptance is incredibly hard but consistency is key, and I found that over time my panic was getting easier to deal with using that audio that encouraged me to face things head on and lean into it. 

Eventually, the attacks stopped. I'm sure I'll have a relapse one day, but with the skills I have learned I feel capable of handling it. This particular audio guides you through the four steps, encourages thoughts and physical actions that help during panic, and is empowering — teaching you that you already have everything you need, and that you're strong enough to get through it.

For anxiety itself, the techniques for panic are applied there too, and when I'm reaching a peak of anxiety, this app is still my go to. Yes I use CBT and other methods, but if things are going downhill and I get that horrible overwhelmed feeling, I know it's time to sit myself down with some headphones in and go to battle once more. I feel stronger each time I survive the severe anxiety. 

I am in no way affiliated with Dare, I just wanted to provide context for why I'm often in comments suggesting it to people who ask for recommendations. It's not an instant fix, and it won't cure anxiety, but if you're interested in the concept of acceptance it's one of the most amazing free resources I've come across. I don't know what I would have done without it. For me, it's a perfect example of what accessible mental health resources can and should look like. 

Note: if you're struggling financially, the app explains that you can get in touch with the developers and they can cover the paid subscription at their discretion.

MentalHealthUK,10/20/21 23:18:31,"The ""system"" is a joke","Sorry this is longer than I planned! And does refer to suicidalness.

I'm 29. When I was 18 I had my first interaction with MH services, although I had been having issues for years. I was cutting pretty deeply and attempted an overdose, although it was rather half hearted honestly. I very much shared only what I wanted to with professionals. I suffered abuse as a child from a chronic alcoholic parent with schizophrenia who was also abusive towards my other parent but I didn't really disclose this to staff greatly because at the time I was naively in a mindset where I couldn't accept that I could have been damaged from my childhood and there had to be something inherently wrong with me. 

Ended up getting diagnosed with depression and was an inpatient twice for short spells, once after the overdose attempt and one after I fell apart after the death of my non-abusive parent. Got taken under the CMHT and had a CPN. Got cycled through AD's, none of which seemed to do a great deal. Also got some therapy. I didn't really find any of it greatly helpful, but then I was never really open to them about my actual history, symptoms or thoughts so I don't really blame anyone but myself for that.

I stopped attending appointments because I didn't seem to be getting anything out of them and I was trying to ""move on."" I did with some success, stopped self-harming, I went back to college, went to uni and got a degree after and started a successful career which was going well for a couple of years.

I've had pretty chronic issues with anxiety, self-confidence and periods of low mood through the years but on the whole I've managed to keep them in check to a degree where I've been able to atleast function. 

The last couple of years have not been good. An ex partner broke up with me while she was pregnant (not planned.) Basically threw back what I'd told her about my MH and the past abuse in my face and questioned my fitness as a parent. Didn't keep in contact during the pregnancy, told me the day after he was born that he was here, named him without me and basically didn't let me be involved in anything. This was at the start of Covid which she then used as a weapon for me to not be able to see my child in person while we were locked down/restricted. He was 14 months old before she ""allowed"" me to actually have any physical contact with him and I was driving the 120 mile round trip to see him for 30 minutes or less before she'd imply he wanted to go home. I have no history with the Police or anything like that so I've found it all deeply unfair. She's not put me on the birth certificate and has basically threatened that if I take it to court she plans to throw all the shit at the wall and hope some of it sticks. I really don't feel strong enough at the moment, and have stopped seeing him after we had an argument.  I feel shit, that I am failing him as a parent just how I was failed. But I really just don't know what to do.

After the break up I went to my GP and said I was suffering a bit, they put me back on AD's and said I could self-refer for counselling. I put the referal in and waited... and waited. It turns out my referral must have got lost.

I've slowly been deteriorating and at the start of this year based off being urged by my current partner I got in contact with services in my new area after suffering with intrusive suicidal thoughts. I was seen by the crisis team for a couple of weeks. I suggested I thought my diagnosis was perhaps incorrect, as did my partner. Nothing was done in this regard and I was discharged back to my GP and told to sign up for the local IAPT. I really didn't get on with it, the entire focus seemed to be focussed on learning behaviours to simply move on which I didn't really feel in the position to do so I stopped after a couple of sessions. I appreciate the need to do this but without unpacking all of the past shit at the same time I don't think it's going to work.

In August I tied a noose to a skylight with the intention of ending it all. It was only then that I rather embarrassingly found out for the 1st time they will flip the entire way around and so my intention to kick a chair away wasn't going to work as my feet would just touch the floor. I looked around the flat for other places but there wasn't anything that was going to support my weight. I know you can do it by just slumping but I felt I needed it to be taken out of my control.

The next day I spoke to my partner about what I'd done the night before and she took me to A&amp;E. Got put under the crisis team again, actually spoke with a psych who diagnosed me with EUPD/BPD this time, which was atleast progress. I spent a week in a charity crisis house, which was actually great. What they thought was fairly basic distraction techniques etc but I came out a lot more determined and actually with some hope. I was discharged back to my GP and recommended by the Pysch to have DBT. I was recommended to refer back to IAPT, which is under a different name now so I didn't realise. Who don't offer DBT.

Thankfully I have private cover via work, so I am now on a waiting list for private DBT by one of the few people within 40 miles who actively specialise in it.

Unfortunatly it just seems to have gone backwards again. The distraction techniques aren't working, the sleep help tips aren't allowing me to sleep. I've felt acutely suicidal for the past couple of weeks to the point each night before bed I've had to basically talk myself out of it.

I'm on a phased return to work. I got to sleep at 7am this morning after having slept 4 hours yesterday and woke up at 2pm. Have completely failed to show up for the period I was meant to work. When I am at my screen I'm struggling to get anything done because I just can't think. I just don't know how I can work set hours when I can't control when I'm falling asleep. I was averaging 4 hours a night in the week for months before I cracked and it's just infeasible as a prolonged strategy. It feels like I'm coming close to wearing out my slack at work, who have been very understanding. And if my career goes then that's one of the only positives I have going extinguished. 

I spoke to my GP late last week who seemed confused why I was referred back to them and not secondary services and said I'd basically need to re-refer to the local urgent helpline and be re-assessed. They text me to say they'd call in an 11 hour window on Sunday. I'd not slept the night before but stayed up, when the window ended I decided to go to sleep. They called 30 minutes later while my phone was on silent and I was sleep. My partner called up yesterday morning and they were going to call yesterday, but they didn't. 

Honestly I'd have got no where without my partner having the strength to constantly badger and nag them to do fundemental stuff that is their job. I can't count the amount of times the crisis team have not come and not bothered to mention or turned up the next day when that's not what they'd said was happening. I thought it was perhaps just me but my partner also seems taken aback by how inconsistent they've been and the lack of any longer term support. I genuinly feel horrendously sorry for anyone having to navigate the system without anyone to fight their corner.

Even now at best I'm probably going to get a couple of weeks of random people turning up suggesting I have a bath or whatever which isn't solving shit.

I'm very much now and all or nothing person. I know I'm close to another night like July, except this time I know to go outside and find a good solid tree trunk. I think about the amount of people who could have been alive today if they'd been given adequate help and it just makes me hate this world more. I've fought for a long time to try and not become another statistic. I've proven before I can get back to being a ""functioning, productive"" member of society in the past, to some degree anyway. I just need some help, help that unfortunatly simply seems to not exist."
MentalHealthUK,10/20/21 22:29:05,Statement addressing certain issues around content,"Hey there everyone, just thought I'd address issues around opinions on content here - this isn't addressed to anyone particular but to add clarification to all which hopefully may be helpful. 

This sub is quite a broad one which has it's pros and cons, one of which that it's likely that a fair bit of content may be irrelevant, unsuitable or not interesting to someone at one particular time. This can understandably lead to frustration when seeing this content pop up and can prompt a complaint or report. 

It might be harder to intially recognise that if I'm to apply subjective views to one post, then it means that it can apply to every post/comment, which hinders my ability to remain as impartial as possible and to respect that different people find different things helpful.

It's important to consider how you would feel if that was applied to you - if I'd removed your content and gave the reason 'It wasn't that helpful' or 'didn't think anyone would like it' as opposed to something like 'this doesn't fit in with rule 5 because it is highly likely it will cause harm to people's mental health/give them certain ideas etc'. 

I'm certainly able to understand frustration with the current limitations on filtering posts, but just trying to strike the best balance possible within these circumstances that doesn't sacrifice impartiality. 

I'd certainly recommend for those who are feeling stressed to take a break and come back, to unfollow but visit and use the search bar or filter by flair, or to just scroll past and bear these reasons in mind (which hopefully helps it feel slightly less frustrating)"
MentalHealthUK,10/20/21 20:24:22,Vent,"I dropped out of uni recently and I don’t feel like I have any control of my life at all. My mental state is the most unstable it’s ever been. I can’t seem to hold any kind of relationship with anyone. All the people I care about seem to leave and I just can’t help but want to just cut myself off from everyone. I feel like it’s best for everyone. Maybe I’m meant to be alone despite how desperately I seem to miss everyone and just strive for any kind of connection

When I dropped out I lost access to my counsellor which I now can’t afford despite her reasonably affordable session rates. It was just something that held some kind of stability over a specified period of time. I haven’t been able to have any kind of in person interaction. My best friend from uni graduated and moved back home across an ocean. I just feel like I’ve lost everything and can’t come up with any kind of plan to move forward into a job or anything. I am so so lost and don’t know where to turn. My nhs primary care provider have been absolutely useless on every attempt I’ve made at trying to get help. I was with my local county’s healthy minds clinic or whatever they’re called for the nhs thing. I was on the waiting list for 10 months and the session was completed useless and so I didn’t go again. My counsellor at uni was extremely helpful but as I said above I need some income to get that back

Thank you for listening. I don’t think I’m wanting or needing any input. I just want to shout into the void I guess. I used to text the shout crisis line when things got back but after so long it just became more annoying than helpful. I stopped talking to friends in an effort to protect them from my bad mental state. I just hope that things improve soon. I don’t know what to do if they don’t"

MentalHealthUK,10/20/21 16:23:35,Looking for advice about my brother,"TW for SH and mention of s*****e

My brother, 14, MTF, has been self harming for around 3 years. He's been seeing a therapist for about 2 years, and is transitioning to male. (His gender identity is accepted by everyone in our family).

He has been s******al on and off for about 2 years (about 4 months ago, my mum found a prep box and removed it)

However, he has recently starting cutting his face into a Joker style smile. He told my mum that he didn't want anyone to know, but is making tiktoks showing his fresh cuts on his face.

I'm worried that this is an escalation and don't know what we should do. He's refusing to speak to his therapist and our mum is trying to get an appointment with the paediatrician.

Any advice is welcome.

We're in East Anglia."
MentalHealthUK,10/20/21 13:52:45,Should I tell my partner?,"Hi, I (26F) am hoping to get some advice from here as I am feeling quite lost and confused. I've been going through quite a bad depressive episode for the past few months. I've been very suicidal and under the care of the crisis team. I live with my partner (28M) and he's aware of my long-standing mental health issues and has always been supportive. Needless to say, he's been worried sick these past few months about my safety and wellbeing. Last weekend, he went away with his friends for a couple of days. I was not feeling well but it kept it to myself as I really wanted him to go and enjoy himself, he deserves it. On Saturday, things got bad and I took an overdose - not a big one but enough to go to A&amp;E. I don't think my intent was to end my life, I felt hopeless and self-destructive. They let me go on Sunday morning and I spent the day in bed recovering. When my partner came home, I pretended that nothing happened and since then, I haven't mentioned anything about ODing. Neither to him nor anyone else. I feel very bad - we usually have a very healthy relationship and I feel like I'm ruining it by hiding this from him. I am torn... I want to be transparent but at the same time, I'm not seeing any benefits of doing so. What's done is done and it would only worry him. I think he would stop trusting me less and our relationship dynamic would change. Sorry for the long post. Does anybody have any words of wisdom? Thanks."
MentalHealthUK,10/20/21 09:53:35,:(,"God, I am in a constant hell and no matter how many times I reach out or try to better myself, nothing improves in the slightest. I am in so much pain and I can't believe I have to go on like this forever.

I have issues in almost every aspect of existence that I never even know where to begin to vent because there's just so, so, so much wrong. People ask ""well, what's wrong?"", ""what's the problem?"" EVERYTHING is the problem. Everything is too much. 

I'm so overwhelmed, am never making progress and I always need to vent somewhere because I'm under constant stress and pain and I need SOMETHING, anything at all to help in any sort of way, but there's just NOTHING. Just absolutely nothing. 

I'm trying so hard but I'm just so done. I'm sick of people acting like it gets better when it never does. I'm convinced I'm not worthy of a happy ending. 

And I feel even more stressed because I need to vent about 50 different things and I don't want to spam all the mental health subreddits but god. I don't know what to do anymore. And every time I say this, moan about not knowing what to do-- it feels like a movie moment, where the main character admits their feelings and suddenly they get help and begin the slow but successful journey to getting better. But no! It never comes! No one ever cares! Nothing is ever fixed! 

I don't even know what the point of this long stupid rant is, I just can't be in my own head right now. It hurts. I feel so far removed from life and humanity and normality. I don't want to wake up tomorrow

I don't even want to end this vent because I need to talk to someone, I need help, even if it's the illusion of help through writing a reddit post no one's gonna care about. I want to scream and shout and have people pay attention and DO something. I want to be magically fixed by the click of someone's fingers. I want another life.

MentalHealthUK,10/19/21 18:57:12,Here to offer a Helping Hand for Dissociation,"Hello, 

My name is Oliver Czekirda and I am looking at creating a better more accessible product solution that helps those who have dissociation as part of a university project. I am very interested in the topic and it is an area which I would love to explore more on. I know of people around me who have dissociated and I would love to support them by developing a friendly solution for them and others ensuring the person feels comfort and helps them in their dissociation.

If you are between 16 - 40 years old, have dissociation and would like to take part then please feel free to fill in the following questionnaire. **This is completely voluntary and the data that you give will be anonymous** ie you will not be able to be identified as a result. It will only take 10 - 15 mins of your time. Your input could greatly help to develop a more accessible grounding tool for dissociation. **It will be entirely your choice which questions you choose to answer** but any input would be hugely appreciated. More is explained in a disclaimer at the start. 

Please find the questionnaire link attached: [https://bournemouth.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/grounding-solution-dissociation](https://bournemouth.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/grounding-solution-dissociation)  

I would like to say upfront that none **of the questions are concerned with the cause of your dissociation**. As I am working on developing a solution to help cope from dissociation, questions will only be concerned about your dissociation and the need for a solution. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at s5103670@bournemouth.ac.uk or to message me

I want to do my best to ensure the questionnaire and the steps taken towards this are safe and friendly"

MentalHealthUK,10/19/21 01:42:32,Do antidepressants help at all?,"So after an OD on pills and 2 days one spent puking and with an IV in all day and night in the hospital I was on my Merry way after saying “ no I won’t try again” to the mental health team mostly because I just wanted to go home by that point. 

Sarcasm aside they were actually helpful and I felt they genuinely listened to me instead of the usual “ just go to IAPT” and said they’d write to my GP but that’s probably because it’s went from depressed to attempt and recommended antidepressants and if IAPT fails try ask for something else 

I’m midway through my sessions of IAPT and it isn’t helpful at all. Making a bloody “well-being box” of my fave movies won’t stop me trying end it.  They recommended I call my GP to try get out on antidepressants. 

My question is do these help in any way? It’s weird because I technically should be happy. I have a job, dating someone, rent my own flat, own my own car blah blah all that shit but I keep having suicidal thoughts more so now once the “ gee glad I’m alive” shit goes and just feel empty and depressed all the time and deal with this by drinking but trying to stop because it occasionally makes any suicidal thought more appealing 

I dunno I feel like I’m very limited with things.  I’m not crazy nor am I attention seeking but I’m tired of feeling unhappy all the time."

I feel terrible, I've started crying again, which is a good thing apparently but too much is coming out at once. There's a massive stigma around mental health and disorders etc. Even in a counselling class apparently. I had a bad day today, been having ""stupid thoughts"" for the past week or so, came very close too. I can't stop shaking, me and my classmates had a group chat before (a few hours ago) it's empty now, aside from me. All I did was ask for help at the reception of a college, now I am abandoned by the people I was beginning to think were my friends. I'm haunted by the fact that I have to go back there, alone, yet again everyone thinks I'm a freak! I guess they're not wrong, it's just so ironic that these people want to help others, it's actually insane. They all claim to be good Samaritans but turns out they're garbage, they were my garbage. I can't stop shaking, I'm in shock, when I was with my friends before I began to care for them but I started to feel like they hated me and I kept telling myself I was just pushing them away because I couldn't accept their care for me in return which seemed rational but, of course, they clearly did! I wish I could form relationships with people that weren't scum and actually cared about me as a person, as their friend even- just doesn't seem likely.

MentalHealthUK,10/19/21 00:35:17,Understanding commitment to therapy/ a therapist,"Hi all, hoping to get some information here and thought this might be a good place to ask.

My partner (C) would like to begin counselling/ therapy and has reached out to a few therapists on online directories. 

For context I have been in therapy myself for about 8 weeks and was very lucky to find a therapist I was comfortable beginning sessions with straight away. They had a sent through documentation explaining ""the work"" and also the commitment in-advance to the sessions. This was both to protect the progress and I also imagine for some job-security for the therapist. They allowed a 48hr notice; and as a client I wasn't expected to pay for sessions if I was away for less than 2 weeks (obviously noted far in advance). This was all written in the one-pager they sent through and we began without any issues.

C had her call with a prospective therapist this evening and felt that they placed a large amount of emphasis on the commitment to the sessions. The fee would be paid weekly, whether or not C could attend (giving a notice-period was stated as possible); and additionally if C was away for any period of time that the therapist was working as normal, the weekly fee would still be paid, regardless of advance notice. The therapist did say they may have some flexibility over weekly times, but nonetheless seemed to stress this commitment. They additionally stated that C ""*may feel worse as therapy begins*""; almost like a pre-warning. The therapist said they needed this commitment also to know how much they were earning for the month.

Neither of us are experienced in professional conduct with therapy and I also feel as if my therapist is more relaxed than some others, **but I wanted to check if this sounded like standard practice?** We're considerate and expect the therapist to have contingencies in place to protect their own employment etc. as a professional, but C was still taken aback. Hoping to get some advice. Thanks!"

I don’t think anyone will. The first nurse I spoke to documented down all my symptoms, but I’m sure the psychiatric will just send me away and do nothing like many before.

It’s an enantiomer of Methylphenidate and appears to be a good alternative to Methylphenidate as it’s also a central nervous stimulant. 

And then, why is Adderall not readily available either? I say readily, as apparently you can get it prescribed in the UK, but it’s rare/difficult. Has anyone been prescribed it in the UK, and if so, how did you go about getting it? 

It seems rather unfair that we’re denied access to both or either of these medications. It limits the options when there isn’t that big of a list of adhd medications.."

About a month after doing this, I had lots of bad news all hit at once and went back on citalopram.

About a month ago I had the annual review. And said I felt fine and no issues. But wasn’t sure if that was due to the medication or if I was ready to come if it. The GP said try coming off it and go cold turkey.

I didn’t think that was a good idea, even when it was only 20mg so lower the dose and stopped completely 2 weeks ago. I’ve had awful withdrawal side affects, feeling spaced out, not sleeping. But have been off work so I’ve managed.

MentalHealthUK,10/18/21 02:20:20,I developed a mental health related app from my personal experience!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

I'm now worried for him, I've spoken on the phone and he is going on his motorbike to go see some close family as he is planning on moving that way.
Stress and a piling on of problem and set back broke him a little (this is an ex-paras and former pro Thai boxer) so he is strong minded, but this got to him.

I've said I'd get InTouch with crisis team and he seems adamant he doesn't need to talk to them. 
I'm fine with that as long as he keeps in touch. 

So today he is getting on his bike and looking to move closer to family. I will be moving in with him once he has got a place. 

I just want to know if I am doing enough by just keeping InTouch. I am going to be getting a train to see him as soon as I can, but due to obstacles that could be a couple weeks time. 

I'm writing this more in a panicked and anxiety state.

MentalHealthUK,10/16/21 02:28:02,I didn't go to college this year - feeling slightly upset and just wish I had done better at school,"Hey everyone,

I made a post a while ago regarding whether I should of went to college or not. I made the decision not to go. I feel like I should of went, but I decided not to because:

1. My mental health treatment is happening very soon
2. The college wouldn't give me a bursary due to the fact because I'm under 24-years old. Any income at ages 24 or above is considered your own
3. If this treatment doesn't happen to work, then I may be referred elsewhere

I just feel like I'm wasting my life and doing nothing productive. I really want to go to college next year and hopefully do some A-levels one day. However, for the foreseeable future, I don't think I'll be doing any form of education yet. The A-levels I want to do have a lot of coursework, so I can't do an online course. Also the nearest college that does A-levels is over an hour away. I may have to move when the time is right because I can't travel 2-hours each day for 5-days a week!

He then offered me generic counselling with Lifelink, which I just accepted because I was taken aback at how I’d just been dismissed like that. I just agreed and then hung up the phone. 

It’s been several months now and I still feel the same as I did before, and I want to call again and really stand up for myself. I think I’m not being taken seriously because a) mental health is usually brushed off as “feeling blue :(“ and b) I am a woman and have been dismissed about almost every physical health problem I have tried to talk to them about 

If anyone here has been through the NHS system for ADHD or getting a diagnosis for anything else, I would love some advice"

MentalHealthUK,10/15/21 19:56:39,PARTICIPANTS NEEDED,"Hello everyone, 

I hope this post is okay here. I am a Trainee Clinical Psychologist in the UK and I am trying to connect with women who would be interested in taking part in my doctoral research project.

This project hopes to understand more about **mothers experiences of trying to protect their children during a violent and/or abusive intimate partner relationship**. Specifically, I want to find out about the impact on mothers when trying to protect children in this context, both psychologically and physically.

I think it is really important that mothers are able to share their story and experiences and we start to move away from the narrative that mothers didn't protect their children during a violent or abusive relationship because they didn't leave or end the relationship. Mother's did not and could not leave for a variety of reasons but they did their upmost to protect their children from the abuse or violence. So what was the impact of this on them?

The research involves an interview with myself, which can take place online or over the phone. All identifiable information will be **kept strictly confidential** and only I will have access to this information. 

**If you would like to find out more then please email me:** [Lydia.smith@coventry.ac.uk](mailto:Lydia.smith@coventry.ac.uk)

There is no pressure to take part and I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have. 

Thank you for taking the time to read about my research!"
MentalHealthUK,10/15/21 14:50:24,Helping a relative seek help.,"Hi everyone, 

I need advice regarding my brothers deteriorating mental health and I'm not sure where to turn. 
I'm no longer in the UK, the rest of my family including my brother are still in the UK. I'm unfamiliar with how it works over there in regards to seeking mental health support. 

My brother is autistic, but there is something else going on. The past 2 years he is getting worse, he suffers from hallucinations. My mum messaged me that he is getting worse, she doesn't know what to do and freaks out at me. 
He doesn't have any active mental health contact with anyone, he even admits to needing help but when he gets a time with the GP he then manages to play along and say he is fine, so nothing happens. 
He has violent outbursts and has assaulted my mum and grandma, but they never ring the police even though they should. I'm worried he will do it again as he is spiraling. I've tried to talk to him and it's like the lights are on but nobody is home. He doesn't even make any sense.
I've called the Crisis Team in their area and asked for advice, they told me to contact the GP. I made him a GP appointment, he didn't attend. I don't know what to do, especially from another country. 

He does need an urgent mental health evaulation, I'm worried for his well being and I'm not sure where to contact. I have my mental health problems as well, and all of this is exhausting me. 

Any advice would be appreciated."
MentalHealthUK,10/15/21 07:05:38,Do Parents *Have* To Know?,"I'm 17 and wish to go to a counselor in my high school (Northern Ireland), but I don't want my parents to know anything since they are usually the cause of most of my problems. Is there a law or school guidance/law that your parents have to know that you are in counselling?

Or say if you're suicidal or are worried you seriously have a mental illness, do they have to tell your parents or is it by your say if they know or not? Just wondering incase anybody knows, since I'm not sure if it's the same as vaccines or such which you have right to without parental say when you turn 16. 

Many thanks. : )"
MentalHealthUK,10/15/21 04:48:03,Does/has anyone else experienced this sort of feeling?,"Hi all,

So this is going to be hard to describe because I feel it more than I can describe it. Does that make sense?

OK, here I go. So, everyone in this single world has memories - good and bad - happy and sad, etc. We can sometimes remember how we felt and then it comes to us in the present and it either makes us feel something. Whether that's being happy, sad, angry, or embarrassed. We can feel it! So back in June 2013, I went on a bike ride with my friend. I had never felt so much enjoyment in my life. Prior to this bike ride, I was highly depressed and I got referred back to CAMHS because my depression was so severe. Also prior to this bike ride, I was no NO medication for my mental health. When I was discharged from CAMHS the first time, my psychiatrist and I thought I'd try no meds to see how I was. I was okay for a few months, until something bad memory had me worried for months on end.

I could ramble on and on about my other memories, but it just feels like I was a completely different person back then. Almost like I was a completely different human-being. Like someone else was living that life and I've got their memories. For example, I know I've literally grown and aged as a person, but it feels like I've lived many different lives and felt many different things. Does this make sense to anyone?"
MentalHealthUK,10/15/21 02:49:45,Making space for oneself whilst caring for a partner who struggles with their mental health,"Hi there, 

I (26M) have been living with my partner (24F) for the duration of any/all lockdowns in the UK over the past 18 months. She is on a journey through anxiety and depression and whilst we have had our fair share of knocks this year, she has come so far and I am truly proud of her. 

I am doing my best as a layperson to support her in any way I can, from making her feel heard to support with medications/appointments etc. Recently however I have found myself getting frustrated/impatient an awful lot, particularly with household matters. She struggles with cleaning up after herself and with taking a share of the housework off of me (reduced or otherwise). Some days she has trouble leaving the house (understandably exacerbated by the lockdowns). I should also add we both work full time from home. None of these battles of hers are new, but these pangs of frustration on my side are. 

I’ve reflected on this a fair bit, and heard one common pitfall for people in my position is failing to ‘make space/time for themselves’. At the moment I can get out of the house for various things for a handful of hours a week, but in the house I struggle switching off from everything and enjoying time with my partner rather than viewing her as a collection of needs to be met. I should stress that I love her dearly and can clearly see that perception is deeply flawed and absolutely not a conscious choice, I just struggle not to focus on this when I am frustrated. My question is twofold. 

How specifically does one go about ‘making space for oneself’ within the home? And how do I communicate about this compassionately with my partner? Thank you for your time."
MentalHealthUK,10/15/21 01:42:01,Emotional support from Holly Health 🙏,"It's so sad to see what's happened to mental health waitlists lately....it's been bad for a long time but never like this. Even for people who decide to go privately, it's really not easy getting help.

I've had my own mental health struggles over the years, mainly related to burnout and stress, and I know most of us have experienced similar things! I've always wanted to create something to help myself, my friends, my colleagues to feel better. 

For me, what makes me feel better is keeping grounded, doing small mental and physical health habits day to day, like spending time outside, or getting my heart rate up for 10 mins, or getting to bed earlier. With my work experience (startups and tech companies), I thought I could build something useful. So I cofounded Holly Health, a mental and physical health app, a couple of years ago with neuroscience and psychology experts, and now we're rolling it out to thousands of people.

The Holly bird (in the app) basically becomes a bit of a wellbeing friend, coaching you through setting up habits, and helping you to keep going with them, with reflective exercises etc. We want it to be as much like interacting with a human as possible. Still lots of work going on to develop it, but people seem to be finding it useful.

I've created a specific offer for anyone in this group, to access a month of the service for free. You can get your code here: [https://hollyhealth.io/reddit](https://hollyhealth.io/reddit). You can cancel any time within that month and pay nothing. We will be rolling out with NHS/local councils but not for a while! Hope this is helpful and not spammy (if it is spammy, i'll remove!)! If anyone wants to ask any questions, feel free to comment or message, Grace xx"
MentalHealthUK,10/14/21 22:03:21,Advice on how to tell the Doctor how much I’m struggling?,"I (23) hope this doesn’t come across silly or anything but I would really like some advice or guidelines on how to tell my Doctor during a phone consultation that I am deeply depressed and suicidal. I want to be taken seriously as I really need help and I’m worried I’ll say the wrong things that will make them think it’s not serious at all. 

Both my parents, my uncle and childhood cat have passed within the last two years, I am not coping with the grief at all. And all the feelings associated with grief. I am struggling to leave the house, keep up hygiene and a lot of days I struggle to get up.

MentalHealthUK,10/14/21 21:15:06,Having a capacity assessment to decide if I can safeguard myself?,"So basically I’m 19/F currently living in an emotionally and financially abusive home situation with an alcoholic parent. I have BPD, autism and other mh problems and am under adult mental health services. 

I have just been told by my care coordinator that I‘m having an assessment with a psychiatrist to see if I have capacity to safeguard myself/make choices about moving into supported living. I’m really confused as I’ve never heard of this being a thing? Only ever heard of being sectioned under the mental health act but apparently this is not for an admission to hospital.

Can I be forced to move into supported accommodation/leave home? How can I physically be be made to leave home and stay somewhere against my will? What could they do if I didn’t have capacity?"

MentalHealthUK,10/12/21 21:17:09,Weird,"I feel connected to the past. When I see photos of my grandparents, I remember how it was like to touch them, hug them, be with them. I remember how it was like to be me kinda. I can't feel attachments to the past... but the present is different. Since I started taking the pills, I became someone else. People have changed their appearence and I can remember who they were and how our relationship was before but I can't see them now and realize how everything is... I can't seem to make the connection between the present and the past. A lot of things have happened and I became someone else. In the meantime, people have died and grown and changed. And I can't seem to connect... The fact that those grandparents I used to recognize became too old and changed and died. And I have grown too. And the people around me. Things have changed and happened and since I became someone else and my life changed so much, I can't seem to connect the dots, the facts... I can remember my grandparents but I can't make the connection to the present and say they are dead. I'm so... I don't know if this is permanent. I want reassurance from someone who may understand what I'm talking about. I want to grieve and be aware of what has happened to know how the present is and how I ended up like this... without losing touch with who I am/was... my past... my relationships with the people I loved... who they were to me... It seems impossible to do it. I don't understand how this may get better with time either.
I am completely disconnected. And it's fucking horrible.
I don't know if it's the trauma of losing myself to the drugs or the drugs' effects... and I don't know which one has better options for recovery."
MentalHealthUK,10/12/21 08:11:26,Semi-toxic relationship,"I've been in a relationship with this girl for just over a year now. It was ok for the first few months but then it started to feel toxic, I had to clear every girl that was not related to me which I ended up losing alot of friendships over but I can understand why she wanted me to. 

Then it started with her constantly wanting to go on my phone asking to play on it but then started looking through everything, it's also to the point where I can't even go to the shop without telling her or she nags me to tell her conversations that I had with my family even if its private, she gets mad when I do things with my little sisters(who are both 10).I'm not even allowed to play any games by myself unless she's working, I get yelled at for even being active on any other social media. However after all this, sometimes she's nice such as today we went out and she's just spent over £200 on me but these random acts of niceness always only seem to happen when I finally prepare myself to break up with her, the last time I was ready to do it she bought me something nice and started acting like she used to and this constantly happens. 

Now I'm getting a job because she's finally allowed me to apply for one and there's a girl thats working there that I used to ""talk to"" and we were kinda close(intimatly) but I havent spoken to her for over a year and since I found out she's there I've started getting feelings for her but idk if she would even still like me and I don't know what to do about this relationship. I don't feel like I can end it now because she's just done this for me but I also can't bare to be stuck in this constant cycle, I'm always the bad guy but get random acts of kindness and now I'm falling for someone that I haven't talked to for nearly 15months. 

My mental health has been really bad in this relationship and people have told me to go to therapy but that would be impossible while I'm with her, I really don't know what to do and I'm struggling to cope. I don't know what to do about the relationship or the other girl.

MentalHealthUK,10/12/21 01:38:34,Is it my brain or is it my job?,"I was diagnosed with depression and GAD years ago and I've been taking meds for the last 9 years or so. I'm currently struggling a lot with feeling tired and angry  have no motivation to do my job, feel complete apathy towards it and struggling with tired of self harm but I'm not sure if it's work or my depression, and what to do 

I'm leaning towards it being work because we've been flat out for the last 18 months with an increasing workload and fewer staff. My team is burnt out but we have no support from senior managers and I've ended up in tears (and sometimes self harming) multiple times. I've reduced my days to working Mon-Thurs because I was struggling to get through the week but that only started this month so there's no discernible difference yet. 

The reason it could be my depression is because I felt similarly a few years ago and I ended up speaking to the GP who increased my meds. But while there are some similarities between them and now, it's not as bad. 

I feel like I've got two options: to go off on the sick and see if that changes how I feel, or stay in work but increase my meds again. I'm just not sure which to do. I don't want to sacrifice my mental health because of my job but I also don't want to feel like I'm taking the piss because I've literally just changed my hours. I'd appreciate any thoughts on this!"

Anyway I can not keep waiting and I need to have help much faster as I have been struggling so much and have been getting worse and worse.  So I want to go private and get a psychologist, however i have looked and its hard to find one for less than £100 which i cannot afford at this time. 

does anyone know anyway to find cheaper psychologists - i have had a long time of being unemployed and do not have a lot of money to pay but i need treatment asap. 

Also does anyone know if its worth getting health insurance - this seems like the only way to get it cheaper, however they don't except pre existing conditions, do you think its worth lying to get on a plan?"

MentalHealthUK,10/11/21 17:49:36,Being vocal about mental health issues,"Good morning everyone. 

I hope you are all doing ok! 

This is more of a rant, really. I apologise if this isn’t allowed on here. 

So yesterday was mental health awareness day. As a result, there was a lot of posts on social media about it. People sharing their stories, offering help, that kind of thing. Which is great, we should all be talking about it, if we are comfortable enough to do so.

However, I also noticed a few unkind posts, not really aimed at anybody in particular, but saying things like “we all have problems, some of us choose not to broadcast it” and other things. 

Yes, maybe we do all have problems, but airing dirty laundry and being vocal about mental health problems are two very different things and these unkind posts lumping them both into the same category isn’t really helping anybody. 

A lot of people choose to keep their issues to themselves, because they think other people don’t care. This is something I struggled with for a long time until I sought help. I never said anything, because I thought nobody cared. It eventually got to a point where I couldn’t function anymore. 

Now I talk about it, because if one person recognises themselves in my posts, maybe they’ll reach out for help too! 

I just don’t understand how people can be so dismissive and unkind! 

It doesn’t cost anything to be kind!"
MentalHealthUK,10/11/21 04:51:20,Anxiety,"Hello lovely Reddit family,

I’m reaching out as I’m struggling at the moment with anxiousness and wondered if any of you could share any tips that you may have that really help switch your trail of thought or switch up negative thoughts?

To give some context, I relocated last year to a different part of the country and with isolation etc it’s been hard making new friends. I’ve made a couple of friends but I miss having that solid group of friends. I’ve also really struggled with working from home and tend to work 16+ hour days and as a result I’ve been signed off with work related stress. I have chosen to use this time off to try and refresh myself and to look for a new job in my new location as a chance to hopefully make some new friends, fully establish myself in my new area and take on a role less stressful. I’ve been successful in finding a role and feel excited until the thoughts in my mind make me panic about the change, if my role will hold me back in the future as it’s a step back and the salary is reduced, as well as thoughts of being rubbish at the job. 
It’s crippling me, so has anyone got any tips or been in a similar situation?

Much love to you all and forever grateful for any help xxx"

So with Covid starting last year work got insanely busy and after having a few weeks signed off sick due to anxiety and stress last May I thought I was doing ok then December came and I was starting to struggle but I was like I have a week off so be fine.  
Turns out I was very wrong and I limped on until the start of February when I just broke completely and ended up signed off with stress for a month and a half.  
I went back when I was ready and took baby steps getting back into work and it all has gone well but it's started to get busy again and overall team moral is rock bottom but I learnt how to cope while I was off and so it's not too bad plus I'm home working so I find it easier to step away and take breathers when I need to.  
But what I'm really struggling with at the moment is my physical health and it's starting to impact on my mental health hence the need to rant.  
Basically at the end of June my 25kg staffy ran into the back of my leg and sent my foot smashing into the bannister resulting in a broken little toe ... It's now October and it's still not fully healed and with the weather turning I'm finding I'm going to be even more limited to how much out time I can have cause I can't wear proper shoes yet so still reliant on the open toe boot from the hospital.  
I'm tired and fed up of this now, I went out a little earlier but now the foot is achy and burning, I didn't sleep much last night and arghhhh!!! Enough already with the pain and the limitations.  
My husband has taken the dog out and it's nice weather out but I'm stuck on the sofa binge watching TV and I'm trying so hard not to just curl up in the corner and cry - I'm kinda failing on the crying front tbh.  
I spoke to my gp on Fri and she's sent an email to orthopaedics for a review but we didn't really talk about the mental health impact or what we can do but jeez I'm so fed up ... Oh and because we're short staffed at work I volunteered to train our new girl via team video calls from this coming week. Wish me luck!"

My line manager was moaning a LOT about a staff member taking a day off here and there for COVID test- her husband was a NHS frontline worker.  So explains the level of testing.  Nonetheless the attitude my line manager had is making me getting extremely worked up sending a email to call off shift.  A risk of penalty from the client.

He was discharged by the psychiatrist over a year a go and as he had no symptoms the plan was the reduce / come off olanzapine very slowly under the care of his GP.

He stopped taking his meds as directed a few months a go but is now experiencing psychosis and delusions again. His GP prescribed a low dose of olanzapine and diazapam. I think he needs more specialist support and quickly - he is acting out on his delusions more than I've ever seen before (although not currently in a way that endangers himself or others). Is there a quick route to get him back with the CMHT?

MentalHealthUK,10/08/21 23:57:20,How do I help my alcoholic mum?,"Looking for some advice please I’m desperate. 

I’m a 19y/o F living with my mum who has had an alcohol problem for 5 years, my dad and 21 y/o sister. My mums drinking has been getting worse over the past year and she is currently drinking a litre bottle of gin/around 26 units minimum everyday, even in the morning and during the night. 

She won’t accept she has a problem and refuses any sort of help, we have tried everything including pouring away or diluting her alcohol, I have begged her not to drink, contacted her doctor etc. She has refused help from CMHT (NHS mental health service) and any alcohol services. I feel my mum is psychologically and physically dependent on alcohol and is unable to stop and needs professional help but she won’t accept it. She seems to have developed a tolerance to alcohol and often doesn’t appear drunk to other people but we notice the subtle signs like her face looking red, her speech and her becoming verbally aggressive. 

I have mental health problems including aspergers and borderline personality disorder and am under adult mental health services in the Uk. This is taking a massive toll on my mental health and making me suicidal, I feel helpless. My mum is emotionally and financially abusive towards me and uses my benefit money to fund her alcohol addiction, I am afraid of her so I’m unable to get my money back. I realise my mum is unable to stop but I can’t help feeling angry towards her and then I feel guilty because that makes me selfish. 

My mum is driving after drinking daily and I’m extremely worried about her and other people’s safety, I don’t know what to do. I’m scared she is going to die from alcohol or end up harming someone else. 

Any advice would be appreciated"

MentalHealthUK,10/07/21 08:16:30,I'm-home mental health visits,"Hello.

I have dealt with depression all my adult life and teen years. I'm now 35. I've tried different medications, councillors etc but nothing seems to work. I'm getting worse. I'm a hiderence to those around me. I have very little mental and physical energy to work on myself, but I want to for the sake of others.

I honestly feel I am never taken seriously, another issue is that as soon as I am faced with a mental health professional I am not quite myself, even if I try to be I put on a natural kind of front, fakeness as it were, but not intentionally. Other thing is, I hate to go out or leave the house so I would struggle to keep appointments. And I have also never found a councilor to connect with or feel comfortable with. 

I feel the only way I can be myself and have professional help is if I can get home visits that is where my true self will show more and I would feel more comfortable.

A friend of mine used to get house visits, but that was in England and I am in Wales so I'm not sure if it's different and I can't ask him how he went about it as he sadly committed suicide some years ago.

I am really struggling and I genuinely feel this would be the only thing that could potentially help me.

Does anyone know if this is even an option in Wales through GP appointment/NHS/charity organisation? I'm not sure I could afford private.

Also I should mention I have a phobia of talking on phones,so helplines are also no good to me. Yes I am impossible. 

Thanks in advance

I was laid off a new job last week and wanted to talk about all these feelings, and the man who answered said that I have a ""I can't I can't I can't"" attitude and that I'm being ""lazy"". Those are the exact words in quotes. I have never, ever in my life had such things said to me by professionals and I feel angry, it's made me breakdown further. The man did not ask my name or anything (to see if I'm on the system, they normally do). Does anyone know what I should do next?

MentalHealthUK,10/07/21 02:55:56,Recovering mind and body," Hi there!

Did you know that physical therapy relates to mental health? The goal of this post is to give you information about the importance of physical therapy in mental health and maybe provide a solution that you have never considered. 

Although physical therapists are not always recognized as mental health professionals, research has been proving that they can have a positive impact. PT has a lot of benefits in reducing symptoms, boosting self-confidence, and improving quality of life, through many approaches. In addition, it’s drug free, non-invasive, secure and has low risk of side effects.

You can count with a person that will look at you as a whole, listen to you and find a solution that you both feel comfortable with. 

“At a time when the links between mental health and physical health are becoming more recognized and the focus on health promotion and prevention more urgent, physiotherapy should not be overlooked.”

As physical therapy students, we believe it’s very important to educate people about this matter, so if you are interested, we’d be happy to discuss it with you!"
MentalHealthUK,10/07/21 00:52:03,"If you have full capacity, does that actually prevent you from being hospitalised?","So last night I didn't have a very good night. I spoke to the same guy that keeps refusing me and he kept saying I have ""full capacity"", therefore, I won't be allowed to come into hospital. Can someone fully clarify the rules about capacity? I feel like reporting this guy because one day if I'm really, really suicidal, he'll dismiss me again and tell me that I have ""capacity"".

Also he kept saying I need structure in my day. The thing is that whether I have structure or not, I'm still mentally ill. Even when I was at school, I had a lot more structure in my day back then and still took a lot of time off for my mental health because I was so ill. I do try my best to distract myself from my illnesses, but it doesn't always work. Once I'm in a crisis, I feel as if I need all the help.

Should I report this guy who keeps saying about capacity? He came to my house once and he kept saying the same things as above - I have capacity and I need structure in my day. I just feel like one day I'm gonna do something really stupid and he'll dismiss me again. 

Thank you all for being understanding. &lt;3"

MentalHealthUK,10/06/21 16:09:04,Awful staff,"Hi,

In Reddit yesterday there was a post about some awful staff at our mental health units.

Well I reported one that made me out to be delusional I  had tried to commit suicide on a busy A road (duelled). The nurse made out I didn't have any idea where I was, I got hold of the police control room notes to prove what I said in the initial call. Why does nobody ever believe us and patronise us so badly

The mental health nurse said 'what really happened? The road is closed for roadworks' I said to her, maybe where you are but I am at least 30 miles from you and the road in total is 126 miles long. She was so dismissive and belittling.

As she is registered mental health nurse I reported her to her regulatory body the Nursing and Midwifery council. They have called today (20 months later) and nothing is being done - nursing and midwifery council suggest I seek help, I asked how I know other mental health nurses won't belittle me and good as call me delusional (surely if I was the police would not have allowed me to drive myself to a friend's house."

MentalHealthUK,10/06/21 04:09:01,How do you talk to your parents about bad mental health?," I've had problems with my mental health for about 5 years now and never really had a serious conversation with anyone about it. I'm currently in YR11 and have mocks in a couple weeks and exams at the end of the school year, I want some kind of help since I'm scared it may only cause more problems for me later on in the year, when starting college and getting a job. Since the summer started my mental health has gotten so much worse and I'm getting worried.

My family's got a fair amount of mental health issues in general and my parents have been some-what supportive when getting help for my siblings, however  I'm scared they might react the same way they did when my uncle was having serious problems if I told them about my mental health, but at the same time they're some of the only people who can get me any serious help. My dad has asked me about it once before, however, I never told him the truth (especially since we were on holiday at the time), my mum hasn't really bothered but I know she would try to help if she knew anything. I'm tired of lying to them so much but we haven't talked about it in a while and they're pretty busy lately so I haven't had the time either.

I'm not a very open and honest person about much and I find it really hard to ask and receive help but I really need it from a specialist and I have no idea how to approach the situation properly. As I mentioned earlier my mental health is getting really bad and its affecting how I do in and how I deal with school, I've started being more closed off from my friends and classmates and not accepting help from teachers even when I desperately need it for any reason. I'm really scared.

Does anyone know any ways I could talk to my parents about getting help for my mental health?"
MentalHealthUK,10/06/21 02:15:04,Not sure what sort of help I need!,"I am feeling a little lost/overwhelmed at the moment, and not entirely sure where I should be looking for the right kind of help, if it even exists! 

Have previously suffered from depression and more recently anxiety, but generally felt better and able to cope. Right now though, I feel lost, and I’m not sure what I need to do to fix it! I was thinking counselling, maybe not quite the right fit. Although it probably would help as I’m getting physical symptoms of my anxiety even though my brain isn’t giving me the same signals at the mo. Plus self confidence/imposter syndrome issues.

I need some guidance about where I wanna head in the future, so thinking maybe a mentor at work possibly but then that’s not gonna help with the brain stuff, although it probably will if I feel calmer. 

Does anyone have any ideas of what/who would be available in the UK to help me figure it out?!"
MentalHealthUK,10/05/21 23:01:54,"Had therapy, but still feeling stressed - any pointers?","I posted on this Reddit at the start of 2021 when we were in the closing stages of lockdown about feeling low and depressed. 

Since then, with a change of a GP surgery I have moved from Mirtazapine to Fluexotine anti-depressants which are now helping me a lot without the mad itching at night I had with the former and had six weeks of telephone therapy for CBT and anxiety management during August and early September. 

Unfortunately, what has happened around me has kind of had an impact. My Mum and my younger brother had to leave their home due to neighbour harrasement who has spread false rumours and have been living with me in my tiny one bed room flat since August. My Mum broke her wrist when picking up my nephew from school in early September. My sister works full-time and her two middle children don't go to school. I have to collect her youngest which is my youngest nephew two to three times a week and have to cook despite two teenagers in all day. I'm walking a mile in between catching a train and I just have no time to just do little. It's a dysfunctional house, and it seems my sister has glossed over her kids issues. 

Throw in I had a disagreement with some former friends online which led to me being accused of slander (You post anti-Semitic hate, you should be called out) and them twisting it trying to emotionally blackmail me about a Christmas present....yet none of them bothered with me during the lockdowns or the stuff my sister went through last year. I don't have any friends locally bar one guy who has been unwell, it's the seventh year of being alone since my ex died and I don't like going to pubs. Throw in there's nothing to do - can't volunteer for anything and it's a bit of a dead town. 

As soon as my Mother is settled and got a home, I was looking at returning back to the Midlands. I have relatives up there and friends and feel it's the magic trick as there's more going on. It just gets me down a lot and I feel all the hard work during those sessions of therapy have been undone. Theres a part of me feeling like packing a suitcase and just disappearing up there staying with a relative and not returning back. 

What do you suggest I do?"
MentalHealthUK,10/05/21 23:00:47,CMHT - again,"After finally finding some luck with promethazine as PRN, my nurse was to try and get me another short prescription. I was honest with her that 25mg worked for anxiety, but I had take 50mg for sleep and that this was not an impulsive double dose, and that I had researched before hand.

The Dr (whom I have seen twice, over 2 years ago, during 4 years with the service) apparently 'does not feel he can prescribed these at the moment' and I'm confused as hell.

The famous line of MH professionals ""what sort of support do you want? how can we help you?"" and it seems the one way they can, they won't. I have tried 5 medications of various types, and also asked about therapy multiple times to be told 'stabilisation work' has to be done first, which doesn't make sense, considering I was already discharged after doing this work previously with no referral for therapy. Whenever I ask, it straight up isn't an option.

I am debating responding to my nurse over text expressing my frustration and confusion. Again, I need the PRN now following an awful weekend. Last time I waited for this prescription, by the time I got it the crisis for needing them had passed.

I'm honesty not sure what the hell I am meant to do now? I realise I can buy these tablets and will be doing so when I'm able to get out to do so, but just like. I can't comprehend what this service is achieving, or even trying to. They seem to make everything absolutely impossible and I don't understand?"

MentalHealthUK,10/05/21 04:46:00,I need advice regarding my parents. Especially mum.,"I left my country because of my parents.  If you have any doubts read my first post where i explain most of it.

Anyway.  My parents especially mum are narcissistic she loves to be manipulative gaslight and control everyone.  They are rich and they usually use this as a leverage or emotional abuse.

They are the reason i fled to UK because life was unbearable and there was no future for me. They fked my life over and my opportunities and chances for a normal life and i had to settle for what i could get.

In any case now my mum its toxic again as i am back here to solve some dental issues.

She is very agitated in general talks a lot and tonight after a long day of driving around i came home to her where she was talking a lot. I was trying to watch star trek and she was continuously interrupting, talked on the phone near me, started to clean out her bag and stuff. 

After some time i asked her to leave me alone to watch my netflix series as i am on holiday and i came here to relax and visit her and the rest of the family. 

She got defensive telling me that i am really stressed even more than her and that i act up because of that and she seemed baffled and her tone was condescending. Like i was the one at fault, i was the one who made her uncomfortable and disturbed her. 

So how i should approach her next time?

I plan to reason again with her and if she is not going to act nice and be an asshole once again I will leave and sleep at my other relatives.  I also have 3 other places my girlfriend owns where i could go.

Oh my family knows how my parents are up to a point and i plan to break the truth with them and tell them why i really left and what keeps me away from visiting as i feel like i hate this place. Also she manipulates my dad as he is away working overseas and i don't dare to disturb him with this now. As he is so stressed and busy with his work as a ship commander.

About a year ago I was finally diagnosed with OCD amongst some other mental illnesses. I was living with my parents before this, I had tried for a long time at my local doctors (to me and people who know me, it is very clear I DO have these illnesses) but the whole practice seemed incompetent and have very bad reviews. I moved away and went to a doctor in my new town and was finally able to get these issues recognised. It was more for my own sanity that I needed to know what was wrong and when I got my results I didn't take any action and didn't get any sort of treatment/medication/counselling for it. Shortly after, I had to move back in with my parents due to covid and losing my job. 

The past year I have noticed it getting a lot worse and getting more difficult for me to handle on my own and would like to try and get some sort of treatment for it. The problem is I don't have those two doctors practices linked(?) so this practice knows nothing about me getting diagnosed and I don't think they'll believe me saying I was diagnosed with these things without some sort of proof. A few months ago I tried to get in touch with the doctors in the other town, but the practice has closed down and I don't know what has happened to my patient record there. I don't want to have to go through all the hassle of going through several GPs and get nowhere again. I'm unsure if it's just my local, or the whole UK in general, but there are definitely issues trying to get mental health recognised.

I guess my question is will they believe me if I say I have been diagnosed? If they don't believe me and refuse to recognise it once again, what can I do? I don't have the money to go private.

Thanks!"

MentalHealthUK,10/04/21 18:06:57,"AMA - I'm an Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP), ask me anything"," Hello,

I  saw that an psychiatrist did an AMA the other week, and it seemed like  that was quite helpful and interesting for some of you to ask questions  and gain answers, so I decided to do an AMA about another profession -  AMHP.

I currently work in England  in a community based mental health service. My professional background  is a social worker, but I have done additional training to become an  Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP). For those who do not know,  an AMHP is a mental health professional (social worker, MH/LD nurse, OT  or psychologist) who has done additional training in the Mental Health  Act 1983, which gives them certain powers under the Mental Health Act.  One of the main powers, is the ability to make an application for  detention under the Mental Health Act (more commonly known as  'sectioning' someone). An AMHP is one of the main individuals involved  in arranging compulsory treatment in hospital. One common myth is that  it is the doctor who decides whether or not to section someone, when in  fact, for the main detention sections (s2, s3, s4) the doctors provide a  recommendation, but it is then up to the AMHP to decide whether or not  to admit them to hospital.

In  addition, I am a service user myself, and have been detained under the  Mental Health Act a number of times, so have experience on being on both  sides of the assessment.

So, feel  free to ask me anything about AMHPing, the Mental Health Act, being  sectioned, social work or anything else you can think of. I (obviously)  won't be giving any details about assessments I have been on to protect  patient's confidentiality, but can give general details about how  certain assessments work :) As I work full time, there may be a delay in my response, but will do my best to answer any questions in the evenings."

Uh so a lot of you must have seen that I have a podcast called ""One Time For A Good Time"" and I've promoted it on the subreddit a few times. Anyways my podcast means the world to me, I talk about my mental health, Sexuality, the insecurities I go through, depression, anxiety and the whole nine yards. When it came to my work I didn't tell my family or anyone close to me because I wanted to keep it close to my heart (which later I found out I should). Sorry I'll get to the point, anyways I was having a conversation with my brother thirty minutes ago and we started talking about things I wanted to  do. So I thought this was the perfect time to bring up the podcast, so I said ""well actually I have a podcast that I would like to pursue"", he proceeded to laugh in my face and say ""who will listen to it?, no one cares about you?, your a bum, you're a nobody, you will never be anything"" etc. My anxiety and heart went through the roof, it led to us screaming at each other for like a good 45 minutes before I just walked away and started crying. When it comes to my podcast I'm already very insecure about it, so hearing my own blood say all those horrible things to me just threw me over the edge. I feel alone and I can't stop crying, I just wish people could love my work as much as I do. I don't know if this is allowed, or if anyone wants to check it out but I'll post it if anyone is interested.

MentalHealthUK,10/03/21 21:22:30,Can anyone shed a light on this?,"Hi all, thanks in advance for reading, I’m really not sure where to go with this.. 
I’m on meds for GAD, have been for 20+ years and thanks to good Drs I’ve been okay for about 15yrs, managed to live a ‘normal’ life, finally get a job. Obviously ‘normal’ has the quotation marks bc anyone living with this will probably never know ‘normal’. 

But hers the thing… (and I’m not looking for anything that rhymes with ‘piognosees’) For the last two years, every two months almost on the dot I go bat shit crazy. I mean, totally out of character. I’m buzzing around, frantic about household stuff and things, can’t quiet my ‘inside voice’ so I’m basically making no sense to my OH. Also (this is horrid) I reach for a drink at like the moment I wake up. Almost like I know I have two days of hell ahead. I don’t eat, I don’t sleep, if I do I wake up and drink weird times during the night and early hours of the morning and all day. But nothing makes my head shut up or me sit the eff down and just chill.

That’s the thing, I’m mostly very chilled get on with my job and life but this happens every couple of months and I really have no control over it. I’m in day 2 again rn and my body is screaming at me that I’m just so damn tired. My mind just disagrees and I just feel like the girl in the Red Shoes. I’m just so so tired.

MentalHealthUK,10/03/21 17:04:17,Obsessed With Religion and Don't Want To Be,"Hello. Namaste 🙏 

When I was around 13 or 14 years old (now 20 years old) I was being emotionally and psychologically abused by staff at school. I have various disabilities including cerebral palsy, autism, Tourette syndrome and  severe, misunderstood cerebral visual impairment. School was hell for 2 years. I was suicidal and depressed and I have PTSD from the experience. I moved schools to a special ed school, and I was abused less, but stuff still happened. 

Now, I have always, for as long as I can remember, been interested in different religions, cultures and philosophies, so I have been doing research for years. Anyway, I decided to become Hindu. I was drawn to it because of the beautiful rituals, fascinating philosophy, amazing worship music and amount of freedom it gave you with regards lifestyle. 

Fast forward to now, and I am absolutely obsessed with it. I try to do pujas each day, meditate, sing worship songs, read everything I can about it, celebrate the festivals etc. How did I become so obsessed? Now, autism gives me obsessive tendencies, but why my religion? 

I don't want to be obsessed anymore, because it's taking over me. Almost every thought I have is religious/philosophical. It gets annoying when all I talk to people about is religion, meditation, chanting, incense etc. Do you know anybody else this has happened to? Could it be a side effect of PTSD?

MentalHealthUK,10/03/21 05:14:22,Need to vent - Cancer/Trauma/OCD,"I’m really sorry if this comes across like I’m looking for attention, I just feeling so low and I need to vent. I’d really appreciate if someone would read this. I know people have it much worse than me. But at the moment I feel like I’m the unluckiest person in the world. 

I’m 27/M from London. I had a great upbringing with loving parents and I’m very grateful for that. I’ve been married to my childhood sweetheart for 4 years on Thursday and we’ve been together since we were 15. She’s amazing and I’m well and truly punching above my weight! In all aspects.
I’ve a good job and earn a decent salary for my age and have owned a home for 5 years. I do feel very grateful for all of this.

But it all started to go wrong back in 2019. In February 2019, my cousin (who was the same age as me) was diagnosed with bone cancer in his leg. This rocked my entire family and watching him go through endless chemotherapy and surgeries was really difficult to watch but he handled it like an absolute warrior.

This triggered my anxiety and I started to worry about my own health. I’ve struggled with OCD since I was a teenager with various themes but had everything under control under my cousin was diagnosed. I started going to the GP with various health complaints like a cough, back pain etc and I was basically told by my GP it’s all in my head.

In June 2019, my wife and I found out we were expecting a baby after trying for 2 and a half years, we were absolutely besotted! Having a baby had been my wife’s dream since she was a child and seeing this actually unfold was extremely overwhelming. I can honestly say it was the happiest few weeks of my life. We went for an early scan around 9 weeks and we were given the heartbreaking news that she had miscarried. Watching my wife’s face as she was having the scan go from excited anticipation to sheer horror is the worst moment of my entire life (and as you’ll find out, there have been some very close contenders).

Within just a few weeks after this terrible news, I started to feel increasingly unwell. I couldn’t shake off this cough, I was experiencing severe back pain every night and I had an enlarged lymph node above my right collarbone. I had chest pain a few times which landed me in A&amp;E only to be given painkillers and sent on my way. A longer story short, I eventually had a fine needle biopsy taken of the lymph node and on 18th November 2019 I was called into the hospital for an urgent appointment whilst I was working, I was told to bring someone with me.

I turned up to the hospital with my wife, mum and dad and I was told I had cancer. A type of blood cancer called Hodgkins Lymphoma. The next few weeks were a bit of a blur to be honest. Bloods tests, more biopsies and a PET/CT scan later, I was told the cancer was stage 4. I had spread to my lungs, ribs, pelvic bone, bone marrow and many lymph nodes. I was advised to start an aggressive form of chemotherapy called escalated BEACOPP which is a high dose concoction of chemotherapy drugs which would give me the best chance of a cure. Unfortunately, it would likely sterilise me so I froze my sperm. I started chemotherapy on 22nd December 2019 and spent Christmas in hospital. I don’t really have to explain but I’m sure you an imagine this was a very traumatic time for me personally and my family. 

In February 2020, after 6 weeks of treatment, I was sent for another PET/CT scan to see how I’ve responded so far. I had the scan and was due to get my results the following Wednesday. At this point, my cousin had been through an entire year of chemotherapy and surgeries to remove his entire tibia with reconstructions. He had also had a PET/CT scan after all his treatment and we were getting out results the SAME day! We had agreed to just WhatsApp each other a 👍🏻 or 👎🏻 depending on our results.

On 5th February 2020, I was actually having chemotherapy at the time I got my results. They had put my wife and I in a ‘private’ room because they didn’t want to give my results in front of others in the chemotherapy room. I heard my consultant approaching the room with her high heels clocking which felt like a lifetime. She walked in with a smile and said ‘great news, it’s a complete metabolic response, no evidence of disease’. We burst into tears and couldn’t believe it, a very special day indeed. As a result of the excellent response, I only needed 2 more cycles of chemo instead of the 4 planned. I sent the 👍🏻 to my cousin who responded saying his results were not back and his appointment was moved to the following week.

The following Wednesday we were told my cousins cancer had metastasised to both lungs which for his type of cancer is not good at all. My head was scrambled, why am I ok but he is not? It was a very harrowing and strange period for the entire family, I was obviously delighted to be in remission but what could I say to my cousin who battled twice as hard with a much more positive attitude than me?

In April 2020, I had finished my last cycle of treatment and another clean scan for me. Months went on and I struggled to adapt back to ‘normal’ life, made especially harder with that whole COVID thing 😉 

Roll on to March 2021, the year out of treatment was really tough for me as I was plagued with fears of relapse. I was experiencing back pain again and started to feel convinced the cancer had returned. Turns out the chemo had triggered an autoimmune condition called Ankylosing Spondylitis which is arthritis of my spine. My mental health still deteriorated and tried multiple SSRIs with little help. My anxiety got so bad I was put on benzodiazepines which is pretty unheard of here in the UK!

I explained my anxiety with my consultant who decided to order a 1 year post treatment scan. Thankfully, it was completely clear still. I just still can’t shake off the fear of relapse?

In July 2021, my cousin had multiple failed lines of treatment and fell very ill and passed away in hospital. I got to see him hours before he died and although he was in good spirits, he was struggling to breathe and the image of his gasping for breath is something I can’t forget.

In the past few months, my wife has been going through IVF. She has put everything into such a long and gruelling process. We found out 4 weeks ago that she is pregnant.

But the reason for this post… tonight she found a fair bit of blood and I think she may have miscarried again. 

We are booked in for an early scan on Monday but I just don’t think either of us can take another hit 😢 the thought of another loss just seems too unlikely and unfair.

I think if it happens I’ll just break, I’m so so scared. 

I’m sorry for the rant but thank you for reading."
MentalHealthUK,10/03/21 03:19:36,Need recommendations for possible work from home positions due to bad anxiety - anyone have any ideas?," Hello everybody!

(Using a throwaway account in case a future employer sees this and doesn't like it for some reason and it somehow links back to me. I figure, better safe than sorry.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for advice from other Brits on where to go to look for \*legitimate\* work from home opportunities. I need to get myself a position of some kind as myself and my partner are starting to struggle financially - I haven't had a proper job in a long time due to my anxiety issues, the last in person position I had I quit after having three anxiety attacks in a month due to the travel to and from my workplace, and that was about four years ago. I used to do online webcam work, but unfortunately I'm not in any physical condition to do that anymore and I need to find something different. Going outside by myself really stresses me out and whenever I do have to do it I end up pouring with sweat and having difficulties controlling my breathing (I'm on 50mg of Sertraline to help with this, but it doesn't seem to do much.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have googled work from home positions myself plenty of times, but almost everything I find is either surveys (which pay very unreliably as I've only ever had one survey actually accept me to participate) or focus groups (none of which have replied to any of my attempts to join) - either that or it's a scam of some kind. (I nearly got scammed a little while back but realised before I sunk any money into it!)

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a great telephone manner, am highly competent with computers and technology and I'm highly creative. Whatever I do would have to be part time as I'm also a carer for my partner who has very serious mental health issues (they are actually working from home, doing Twitch related stuff, but they make pretty substandard pay and its not really enough to make ends meet). I got pretty solid GCSE results and have a college degree, but just can't find anything that I can do in my current mental health &amp; physical condition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody know of a place where I can find legitimate, genuine work from home opportunities?"
MentalHealthUK,10/02/21 23:27:44,"At a bit of a crossroads regarding my mental health, advice appreciated.","So this is going to be a little bit ramble-y, and I apologise in advance for that, but my head's a bit of a mess at the moment.

To give a bit of a background to my issue, due to a combination of work stress + the winter lockdown, I developed a pretty severe panic disorder back in February, which has slowly been getting better, but still impacts my life pretty significantly, to the point I still have pretty regular panic attacks over minor things like my heartrate going up, or being outside for extended periods of time, or even just feeling hungry.

To the present, I finished my industrial placement around the middle of September, and moved back to to my Uni city the day after. Due to the abysmal rental situation here right now, I ended up having to go back into student halls. Under normal circumstances, I don't think this would actually bother me at all, as my flat mates are quite lovely and fairly quiet and respectful people. However due to my panic disorder I'm finding it difficult to even cook in the kitchen, which has made my diet quite a bit worse, and overall since moving down my panic attacks have gotten slightly worse, and my stress level is higher.

I also recently just started up my Uni classes again, only to discover I'm only in Uni for one day a week, for work that could quite honestly be done online anyway.

All this combined has made me worry about a number of issues, particularly as this is my last year of Uni and I want to do as well as I can grade wise. I discussed the matter with my parents a bit, and the two things I'm considering are as follows:

Stay at my Uni city in halls and continue just trying to power through, or go back home for a month or two to try and work on my anxiety further, especially since most of my Uni work is online anyway.

Now right off the bat, as much as I want to stay in my Uni city, I have to recognise I'm struggling here, and that staying at home, at least temporarily, would give me a lot of advantages:

* It's in a quieter more residential area, so it's far easier for me to go out for walks in a less stressful environment to help desensitise my body from having panic attacks when outside

* I have a lot more space at home, which means I'm not just cooped up in a small dorm room with barely the space to swing a cat

* It's an environment I'm far less stressed out in because it's home naturally, which gives me a far better grounding to work on my issues

* Having a kitchen I'm only sharing with family means I'm far less likely to have panic attacks whilst using it, meaning I won't put off cooking in favour of unhealth takeaways, and even on days where my anxiety is quite bad, my parents would be able to help with cooking food

On the other hand in my Uni city:

* It's where the bulk of my friend group is, and it's location makes it significantly easier for me to travel around and see people

* It's where my Uni is, so I'll be missing out on attending in person labs, and in person discussions with my dissertation supervisor, as well as access to the labs for my capstone project, even if it is only a temporary move

* I'll miss out on attending a lot of the student societies running, including a lot of useful academic ones and the networking that comes with that, particularly the initial stuff

* I worry that if I move out and give up my student halls because of this, I might struggle to find a place to move back to later, because of how utterly crazy the rental market is right now 

I'm just super torn on what to do. It's going to be massive hassle moving my stuff back up if I do go back, but I recognise there are potentially benefits to doing so. Getting into better shape and exercising regularly alongside eating well would probably do a tonne to improve my stress and anxiety levels, and I'd definitely have a much easier time doing that at home, as it's far easier for me to deal with having a panic attack from my heartrate going up due to exercise when I'm near home, than if I was in the middle of a busy gym down here.

I'm just really torn on what I should do. I don't want to give up living here and have to move back, even if it's only for a month or two, but even so, it might be the best way to handle my mental health."
MentalHealthUK,10/02/21 07:04:20,Useless care coordinator,"When I left hospital following a voluntary inpatient admission, I was assigned a care coordinator through CMHT. I’ve seen her once or twice a week for a month now and she seems useless. She’s been late to almost every appointment; she seems to know nothing about autism (I’m autistic); she keeps telling me she’ll bring me things to read before our next appointment and either forgets or has lost the thing she wanted me to read. Most of the time she just looks at me without saying anything. 

I asked her last time I saw her what the long-term plan was. She said they have groups that might help me but I won’t be able to join them because I work full time. That was it. 

I don’t feel I’m getting any support from her at all. I don’t think she takes me seriously. I’ve told her I’m going to try to kill myself again and I have the means to do so, and she just looks at me and says nothing. I’ve stopped taking my medication and she doesn’t seem bothered. I don’t know what to do. 

I’d hoped going to hospital would mean I’d finally get some decent support but it hasn’t worked like that. What can I do? I feel like I need to do something to make her take me seriously but I’m trying really hard not to. Is it my fault for being bad at talking about my feelings?"

MentalHealthUK,10/02/21 03:26:14,Considering suicide.,"I am 24 and have had depression and social anxiety for 10 years. Its completely ruined my life. I've had 5 years of counselling, completed CBT and tried 7 medications at different dosages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since 16 I implemented lifestyle changes into my life which I continued for years. Working a job, changing job, working out with weights and cardio, eating healthy, making food from scratch, baking, drinking plenty of water each day, eating 3-4 times a day, protein shakes, tracking calories, taking multivitamins and good quality fish oil, stretching routines, drinking green juice every morning, growing my own vegetables, avoiding alcohol, keeping busy, eliminating caffeine, reducing sugar, getting outside, going for walks, walking my dog, had friends, had girlfriends, having a sleep routine, prioritising hygiene, keeping my house/room tidy, reading books, meditation, playing guitar, waking at the same time each day, staying away from negative people.... I've applied everything I've learned in therapy. And after doing all of that, even though I kept it up, I have felt exactly the same way. ALWAYS in fight or flight mode even after being in the same situations thousands of times. ALWAYS sad and hopeless, exhausted, empty. My body always feels weak and heavy. I think about suicide every single day. Everyone always tells me the same stuff. ""Try exercising and getting outside more"" ""eat probiotic yoghurt to sort your gut bacteria out"" ""meditation will change your life"" ""find something you love to do"".

&amp;#x200B;

The frustrating thing is I see people who went straight for the pills and got to see a psychiatrist straight away in the UK. They didn't try therapy or lifestyle changes and have never worked out or read a book. They just took the pills and they helped them and now they are enjoying their life. Even the people in my own family. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there is nothing left for me to do. Doctors tell me the same stuff over and over again. I have been referred to the mental health team and they will help me try other medications apparently, but im not spending more years of my life being a Guinea pig and being given pills only to feel hopeful and find out they don't work. I'm so done with living and I want out. I have researched methods of suicide online and have opted for inhaling large amounts of helium. From what I have read it is a fairly certain and painless death. I'm not telling my doctor that I have a plan because I'm not being locked up in a hospital or having police knock at my door to stop me.

MentalHealthUK,10/02/21 01:00:35,What do you say in psychiatrist appointment?,"Hi, I know am lucky in that I have access to a psych I see every 3/4 months for 20 mins in the NHS. He generally says/writes in the report that I don't know what I want to say/ask for/talk about. 

I'm a bit unclear what people do say or ask for etc. I'm not on medication so that is out. I have private therapy so that covers asking for that. Like what else is there? I'm not in active dispute re diagnosis as can't see the point. 

He leaves me to start the conversation and we will literally sit in silence for 5-10 mins. 

What do you all talk about?"

MentalHealthUK,10/01/21 20:22:03,"I'm concerned about my Brother's mental health, but he is resistant to any help. Is there anything I can do?","Apologies if this is the wrong place for this question.

My older Brother (30) is currently living with me and has done since just before the Pandemic. He always used to be such a happy and hilarious guy to be around. In 2016 he was diagnosed with Crohns disease which, until the pandemic had been relatively mild. Since I would say 2018, his personality really shifted to being quite a miserable, grumpy person. Since the pandemic, whilst living with me I feel he has been showcasing symptoms of depression; stopped caring about the way he looks, become lazy, has zero willpower or energy, he sleeps every hour of the day he isnt working, he purposefully tries to antagonize and upset people, he has become verbally aggressive and incredibly confrontational to the point that simple, honest requests (e.g asking him to help me unload the car of shopping or to tidy his drinks away when he goes to bed) will be met with snide comments, anger or instructions to ""do it your fucking self"". He is incredibly mean with money and has saved a pile of over £150k which he refuses to do anything with. He tells me it is to buy a house with eventually, but this is a lie as he doesnt take the notion of house buying seriously and often will talk about how he will never be able to afford one. He refuses to socially interact with anyone outside of family anymore - he doesnt want a relationship (he is straight as far as I'm aware) as his colleagues (a bunch of miserable 40+ yr old divorcees) have all convinced him that relationships are for 'idiots' and will only end up in divorce and economic ruin.

Over the last year or so, he claims that his Crohn's has gotten worse. Now, whereas before he just needed to be careful of certain  foods, almost everything seems to cause him to complain of flair-ups. It has gotten to the point that he can barely eat anything I cook (he contributes to the food bill, so we cook for the house). He now pretty much refuses to eat, using the excuse that it will cause him discomfort, despite all of these things being foods he loved and could eat just 6 months ago. I have told him to go to the doctors more times than I can recall, I've tried sitting down with him for heart-to-hearts about it and he just aggressively rejects help. Since his latest 'flair up' of Crohns, he has lost 3 stone in 2 months. This morning, he admitted to me that he has reached 9 stone exactly, as a 6 foot 2 inch tall bloke. He looks like a skeleton. I'm deathly worried for his health and near enough screamed at him that he needed to book a doctors appointment. He did this, finally and he is booked in on Monday morning.

However, I'm also worried about his mental health. I genuinely feel he is in a deep depression and has been since 2018 but that it's getting drastically worse since the Pandemic. I feel that most of his health concerns regarding Crohns are largely or at least partially caused by his mental health. He has become almost unbearable to live with and I'd be lying if I said I hasnt considered just evicting him from my house, because his dour, miserable attitude to everything is putting me into a spiral myself. I have discussed his mental health with him many times and have expressed before that he should seek help and he simply dismisses this and interprets it as an insult.

He refuses any notion of his mental health being in decline. But I feel that this is itself a symptom of his depression - I feel he is scared of having to admit it and doesnt have the willpower or energy to combat it, despite my efforts to show support whenever possible.

It seems like it's coming to a head with me. He needs to get his health sorted, but he turns away any help or suggestions that he should seek assistance. Is there any way that I can take things into my own hands and get him the help he needs? I'm at a bit of a loss."
MentalHealthUK,10/01/21 05:58:26,Reasonable adjustments for depression,"So I've had a rough year and I had two jobs lasting about 6 months each which didn't work out because of my poor state. I took about a month off and now I'm back working part time for a company I used to work for, which has been working out ok because I can cope with making it through a 4 hour shift. Combined with the fact that I was familiar with the company and processes already, it's the kind of easy job I need right now. 

However, when I first started, shifts were usually starting at 10 or 12, which is ideal for me, but they've now started putting me on 8am starts. I am very much not a morning person and getting up 6.30am is difficult for me, and one of the jobs I had last year involved early morning starts which was really wrecking me. 

When I was hired, the place was under new management and they were working out how all the new roles would fit in, and now they've decided on 8am starts. But there are a couple of other people doing the same role who start later. They started working there before me and I don't know them well enough to ask about it. 

With the 8am starts, I have trouble getting up in the morning and then I usually end up falling asleep in the afternoon, further impacting my ability to fall asleep again at night. I feel like my whole day is wasted for the sake of 4 hours work because all I do is sleep. 

I like the role I'm doing and don't want to change to a different position. Rationally, I don't see a reason I wouldn't pass the 3 month probation, but I do feel anxious about rocking the boat before then. 

My plan was to have a casual chat with the manager and just say that I'm struggling with the early mornings and ask to change to 10am starts. It might go fine and no problems, but I would like to be aware of what I can ask for in reasonable adjustments. Would a change in hours be reasonable given that it's basically because I'm not a morning person? And I was wondering about even getting the same days every week because the constantly changing rota is hard as sometimes I'm only working two days in a row, but other times I'm working 4 days in a row which can be draining even though it's only part time. 

I don't really want to speak to them about my problems in any great detail, but I'm also quite aware of the fact that they've not asked for a medical disclosure. As I understand it, my mental health is only a protected status from the moment they're aware of it. 

Sorry, this ended up being ridiculously long. I think I'm just overthinking everything! Any other tips or comments about dealing with depression and anxiety in the workplace? Thanks!"

MentalHealthUK,09/30/21 16:00:02,"Reaching the end of my rope, not sure where to turn now","So I've been having mental health struggles for about four years now, and I think it stems from my inability to actually do things (if that makes sense). Like, I find it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to complete or even start tasks, even ones that I'm really eager to do. I thought for the longest time this was just natural laziness, and because of that I think I started to develop general anxiety and depression - but I've recently come to think it might be a form of executive dysfunction, that might be linked to autism I may or may not have.

The upshot is, I managed to get into university but a combination of the pandemic and this malaise I haven't been keeping up with my work and have failed the year (and will probably be kicked off the course). I haven't told anyone I know about this yet, not even parents (worried they'll think I was just a layabout) or close friends, because I've been so scared and nervous.

I did contact the NHS before (about generalised anxiety and depression) and was put on an IAPT course, but was unable to complete it, due to laziness/dysfunction/whatever mentioned above. My main question is: do you think the present circumstances would allow me to seek more specialised or just different treatment that might help me combat this? (I've been scared they'll just refer me to the same service and I'll be stuck going round in circles.) And if they do put me back on it, how to go about doing it with my condition? Any advice around the whole university situation would also be greatly appreciated. Sorry if this is incoherent."

MentalHealthUK,09/30/21 04:18:44,Feeling so lost and hopeless about the future,"I'm always venting here, oops, but journalling didn't quite hit the spot tonight.

Today I received a message from an old friend from school, they added me to a chat with others I haven't spoken to in years and we arranged to meet up. I'm not 100% sure why, but this has led to depressed and anxious feelings building all day. High school was difficult for me and I think I'm maybe having a wired response to the idea of being around them again cause they remind me of it. On top of that, I'm having these weird feelings of inferiority — imagining sitting around a table with people who may ask what I'm doing with my life and I'll have to conjure some decent response. The truth is, I'm out of work and I have no idea what I want to do. I have limited options due to young me leaving school and I am scared whenever I think about my future. I constantly feel lost, sad about it, and label myself as someone who could never be fulfilled. I'm aware these are negative distorted thoughts, but I imagine being judged about it and having to leave the safety of being so far removed from my old social circle, and by extension having to think about where these issues started.

I've used my whole therapy toolkit tonight (being realistic about others judging, reminding myself your 20s is a normal time to feel lost, being clear about the fact I don't believe a person's worth is tied to their productivity) but don't feel any better. It's making me not want to go. I also have been having skin issues lately which is a source of social anxiety  - so that too is affecting my confidence. I just feel lesser than. I'm not sure where to accept this feeling and hopefully lower the distress or keep trying to logic punch my way out of it. I'm not used to feeling this way, I'm generally self-assured and value my positive traits, but I feel worthless.

When I was a teen I saw no life for myself. I self sabotaged and friends watched me, and they were kids so didn't understand or have empathy. Speaking to them has sparked some vulnerable feelings and I feel so down that I'm having automatic self-harming thoughts. I'm not in any danger but I wish I knew what to do. I feel trapped in my little town I've always wanted to run from, and that there's no sparkly future waiting for me at the end of all of this effort. That's the depression talking, but it's so convincing. The only thing that motivates me to keep going is I know others have felt this way and ended up happy. Wish I could drive 100 miles away and start new"
MentalHealthUK,09/30/21 02:06:43,Eco-anxiety (worrying psychological response to the climate crisis) is becoming increasingly common and prevalent now. What are your views on this?,"Sixty percent of young people between 16 and 25 are very or extremely worried about climate change. Seventy-five percent call the future 'frightening,' and 56 percent believe humanity is 'doomed.' The levels of anxiety appear to be most significant in nations where government climate policies are considered weakest and the perception of government inaction strongest."
MentalHealthUK,09/29/21 20:41:07,Dreading appointments,"Having my CPN come visit makes things worse. If the appointment isn't in the morning, I spend all day stressing waiting until she comes only to fail at talking about anything I need to.

If its a good day, of course I don't want to ruin that by talking about the shit times. If its a good day too, I feel they would immediately not care about the bad stuff.

She's meant to come in about an hour and I'm stressing out so much because I've already wasted half the day being anxious and stressed with all sorts of weird emotions bubbling inside of me, and after the appointment the chances that I'll then be too upset to do anything is almost certain.

I'm so tired of this endless loop. I don't know what to do anymore."
MentalHealthUK,09/29/21 19:38:06,Mother and baby unit referral FINALLY,"Yesterday I discussed my suicidal thoughts with the nursery nurse and she updated the mother and baby team who have taken it seriously.

I've just had a visit from the perinatal psychiatrist and have a really long, open and honest conversation. 

I've been instructed to stop my course of sertraline to see if my sudden dip in mood is a side effect or worsening of my depression. If it's the sertraline they will try me on something else. They also asked me how I felt about the Mother and Baby Unit and I admitted that I've found myself googling private mental health hospitals on many occasions so very open to it so they are going to refer me and hopefully get me on the waiting list. I suddenly feel really optimistic!"
MentalHealthUK,09/29/21 16:52:24,Any therapists that will do longer monthly sessions rather than weekly?,"I’ve engaged with therapy on and off for the past 10 years. I’ve been more off than on. Every therapist I’ve been to has only ever offered weekly hour sessions. About 5 years ago I went to one private therapist who allowed me to do every 2 weeks (as I couldn’t afford weekly at the time) but she had a strong view that therapy was most beneficial on a weekly basis- but we didn’t click and I wasn’t getting any benefit from the therapy. 

About 8 months ago, I registered with a local charity getting low cost counselling from therapists in training- this was weekly and there was no leeway with this. I found the sessions beneficial to an extent but more so to have someone there as a sounding board. I’m feeling better but 1 month has passed since the sessions finished and my anxiety is starting to get worse again. 

I think weekly sessions are too regular for me- as I can have a few good weeks and then feel like I don’t need therapy anymore. The past few nights I’ve been having nightmares reliving traumatic events from my past and I think it’s because I don’t have that person to check in with that it’s slowly getting worse. 

I think I would be much more suited to monthly sessions that were maybe 2 hours long each time but I also understand that beggars can’t be choosers and I have to work with what’s available and I understand why the sessions are weekly but surely with how different and varied people are, therapy should be reflective of that.

Does anyone have any experience with this format of therapy? Is it something that is available out there? I’m at a place in my life where I am able pay privately if needed.

Tldr: anyone have any experience with accessing monthly counselling sessions rather than weekly? Did you find them helpful?"

I’ve previously tried a number of medications - Citalopram, Sertraline and most recently Venlafaxine, but was left feeling either no different, at low-medium doses, or emotionally numb at higher doses.

MentalHealthUK,09/29/21 05:35:52,People’s experiences with accessing MH support privately,"Following on from my [similar previous post relating to accessing MH support through the NHS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/pxg5gn/peoples_experiences_with_accessing_mh_support/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I’d also like to find out people’s experiences with accessing MH support privately.

I’m fortunate enough to have BUPA private healthcare at work and even more fortunate that they will support pre-existing conditions. 

When I rang up their MH team they advised I should look on their consultant/therapist finder website, but I’m not 100% what support or professional I would need. In addition, how do you go about picking who might be suitable - a counsellor, a psychiatrist or a MH consultant, for example? 

Have those who’ve opted for private found the experience and outcome better than the NHS? Are treatments limited and what is the after care or further support options like?"
MentalHealthUK,09/29/21 05:16:16,People’s experiences with accessing MH support through the NHS,"First time user of Reddit and first post in this group 😎 

I’m looking to find out people’s experiences with accessing mental support (particularly those suffering with anxiety, depression and PTSD) through the NHS. 

My own personal experience is that unless you’re experiencing or showing signs of crisis (psychosis or suicide) then it’s so easy to fall through the cracks. 

I realise how under funded and resourced the NHS is generally and even more so for mental health services, but it’s really disheartening when you’re suffering to feel you’ve got limited support options, or worse - no options. 

I feel like when you speak to your GP or do research on local mental health services, you’re not given full details of the options and treatments available i.e. if medication &amp; talking therapies (the standard treatments offered) don’t work then “we can try X, Y, Z and/or we can refer you to….”

Also, the information you can find makes it sound like you can only get limited support and treatments, 6-8 sessions of talking therapies, for example. You’re made to assume that if this doesn’t work then that’s that, which, particularly for me, makes me feel more despondent, hopeless and pondering if it’s even worth engaging.

It would be amazing if the NHS, GP and local MH services’ websites had this sort of information displayed clearly - a flow diagram would be perfect, which displays a patient’s potential journey through MH services, for example. 

Is this the same experience people are finding for themselves or are there’s different? Also, is it a case you need to complete these initial sessions to potentially be moved up through the tiers of care?"

MentalHealthUK,09/28/21 22:47:22,NHS Right to Choose for mental health treatment?,"The local mental health services are flat out refusing to see me anymore. I'm blacklisted from the crisis team, A&amp;E send me home and refuse to admit me, the mental health team discharged me because my caseworker ""wanted more free time"" (his exact words to me). I am very suicidal, I have recently started self harming again after 2 years clean, and I'm close to relapsing with drugs. I can't access any IAPT either as they say my mental health is too severe. I believe SIM is the reason I'm being refused help. Everyone is telling me no and sending me elsewhere to places that also tell me no. I feel so alone and I can't cope anymore. I am desperate for some help. I lost my job recently because of my mental health and I can't get any benefits so I can't afford private.

For a long time I thought I had ADHD and I've managed to get an assessment through Psychiatry UK. This is through Right to Choose, so basically it's private but through the NHS. 

Is there anything like this for mental health treatment? I know therapy works but I can't afford it and none of the local places to me will take me on due to the severity of my mental health. 

I feel that without any treatment I will not make it another few weeks. I have BPD, OCD, PTSD and Im' also autistic which is part of the reason they are saying they can't help me as they aren't trained to deal with autistic  people?"
MentalHealthUK,09/28/21 21:23:25,Is it the medication or my depression?,"Hi all. I am currently on 30mg mirtazapine and I feel absolutely hollow inside. My face feels like a lead mask, I feel like I have forgotten how to smile, laugh, even feel an emotion other than this all-consuming emptiness. It feels like my soul has gone and I am just my physical body existing, waking, working, sleeping, repeat. Oh, other than my anxiety is still sky high! I am currently undergoing counselling, had two sessions so far, but I just feel like the depression symptoms have got so much worse and think it may be due to the medication. It could also be that I have just run out of mental energy to maintain the ""happy me"" masque and now I am dealing with a new me, that does not (cannot?) pretend everything is ok anymore. I feel like my fundamental interactions with people have changed and I feel both vulnerable and numb around other people. People who always saw me as happy now don't and it makes me want to avoid them. But at the same time I feel desperately lonely. 

I guess I'm rambling now, so shall try and corral my thoughts. I don't know if i should consider coming off the medication to see if that is what is causing this or if I should persist with meds and see if the counselling makes a difference to my mood. My concern is that if the medication is numbing me emotionally then will that hinder any progress with the counsellor?

Does anyone have any advice and/or has anyone found a similar experience? I am finding this community invaluable as a safe place to vent and also to offer my own support and advice. Anything would be greatly appreciated.

I've ben doing DBT and I'm in secondary care and nearly every single patient in my group has been in inpatient and most have care workers. Some join the team meeting from the hospital. It kind of makes me feel invalidated and that i""m not as sick as them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've obviously got a long past of SH, I have scars, and suicidal ideation etc that got me referred to secondary care, but I would just tell people I was going to off myself like a week AFTER the crisis, mostly because I was terrified of what would happen to me. When I eventually plucked up the courage to call the GP they asked me fi I wanted to end my life and I was like ""not rn but if you asked me a couple days ago yeah"". Then I just went on an 18 month wait list lol

Idk how sick you have to be to get one, but I struggle quite a lot and feel alone, especially when I'm in crisis I feel like no one cares.

MentalHealthUK,09/28/21 02:11:43,Second counselling session felt more draining than the first.,"I had my second counselling session today. Felt emotionally drained before I even started, then poured out a long rambling tearful monologue covering so many different areas. Found it so hard being so vulnerable and open and then seeing them just nodding, taking in what I'm saying but responding in a totally emotionless way. Really fighting the urge to just stop or all and run away from the counselling but I know it will harm me in the long run. Then the session ends and I'm sat alone and feel exhausted and drained. It's slightly surreal too as such intense emotions and feelings during but then after it all just seems like it didn't happen. Anyone else find that?

This completely terrified me and I fell apart, I spent around about two weeks just living in complete fear for my best friends life and was so worried, I started having breakdowns and anxiety attacks. Luckily for me, my friend is finally getting help and they’re not planning on suicide again. This was abt two weeks ago and I’m still struggling. I have had a few anxiety attacks, I spend quite a few hours a day with anxiety and a sinking feeling in my stomach and I’m just struggling to get back on track with my life - my schoolwork is falling behind, I constantly feel tired and lethargic all the time and I feel like my mental health is taken a real toll and I can’t seen be bring myself back into my usual self - I’m literally beginning to cry as I write this. The most bullshit thing abt all this is that everything is now fine. My usual schedule of college, studying, exercising and everything in-between is fine, my friends are fine. Literally everything is the exact same as before my friend started talking of suicide. But I’m still struggling and idk what to do to get back to my usual self even tho everything is fine. I really just need someone to talk to and need advice."
MentalHealthUK,09/27/21 23:31:17,Parents who experience anxiety – help test a free online program developed at the University of Sussex,"We are a team of psychologists at the University of Sussex who focus on parent and child anxiety. We have worked with countless parents who have anxiety. We are also parents ourselves and we know how hard it can be. We have brought together the latest evidence, as well as our clinical experience, to develop an online course for parents which offers practical tools to help them be more confident in their parenting and to boost the confidence of their children.

We are looking for parents of children aged 2-11 who experience high levels of anxiety to take part. Find out more at [www.parentingwithanxiety.org.uk](https://www.parentingwithanxiety.org.uk)

To ensure we test the program as thoroughly as possible, half of the parents who sign up will not use the online program. We will just ask these parents to complete questionnaires. However, every parent who signs up is equally important to the success of our work and we really value every contribution.

By getting involved you will be helping improve support for the countless other parents who experience high levels of anxiety.

Anyway, I self-refferred to Let's Talk (therapy people) on 17th September and they said it would be 21 days - which isn't too bad under the current circumstances. 

Anyway, I called them up today. I've been shot down by ongoing issues, money issues, and just a shitshow of life. Asked if it could be brought forward at all because I'm going through the worst period of my life right now. 

Their answer. ""No. All existing appointments have been delayed until November"" 

So, they won't do anything until November. I explained to the woman that I was having suicidal thoughts and at my worst, been so deep in a crisis I couldn't see a way forward. Explained it all.

Nothing. Nada. November before I can get a call-back. 

Nothing will happen for two months. Unless of course, I ring 999. Or if I kill myself. Then people would become aware that yes, there are problems and it was raised but two months is too long of a wait for anybody with mental health difficulties."

MentalHealthUK,09/27/21 18:35:51,"Dissociation, losing consciousness, not eating, self harm","My partner is suffering from CPTSD and has recently been let down by many in her support network after struggling to eat during a deep depressive episode. This has resulted in her not having had more than a few mouthfuls of food in 3 weeks. Yesterday she passed out 6 times, one of which lasted 20 minutes before I could get her to open her eyes. Some of these were part of dissociation but some just happened. During a particularly dark moment she self harmed. She's so weak at the moment I feel like her body is shutting down. One time she passed out at the top of the stairs. Thankfully she fell backwards rather than fall down the stairs. I work in a bar so do not get sick pay. If I go to work I'm scared of what I'll find when I get home. We already have money problems so not going to work would only add to the stress. This morning she called her GP and they said it's not an emergency so the next available appointment is 1st November. This is also the date of her mental health assessment.

I get asked by the mental health team if I have made plans to end my life and I don't know what to say. I definitely have suicidal thoughts and have thought about how, where and when I would do it but I don't know how much intent there is behind these thoughts. Is there a difference?"
MentalHealthUK,09/27/21 07:46:41,Struggling with anxiety and self harming/suicidal thoughts,"If you come across this post please, I beg you, read until the end.

Hello, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend who I also consider my bestfriend. My life is not going very well at the moment and I feel like this was kinda the last straw. He told me he has some problems with his mental health and feels like he needs some time to himself. He says that if he can not care for me (because of the state he is in) then there's no point in staying together. To give some context we started as fuck buddies right after he broke up with his ex and then got into a serious relationship but have never said ""I love you"" to each other. He told me that he is feeling insecure about our relationship because of this as well. I feel like I am not enough for him even though I am putting my heart into this relationship. I feel so insecure because he loved his ex so much... I often ask myself what do I not have that she does? I admit that I am not a very easy person to deal with since I come from a past of emotional trauma and abuse and feel unconforable doing various things like complimenting him and saying he looks cute and so on. This and some other behaviors bother him but are not the cause of the way he is feeling. I am feeling very overwhelmed by this whole situation given the fact that I do not have a job and my family is really struggling financially. I've been finding myself having thoughts about self harm and have had various anxiety attacks where I feel like I have a huge weight on my chest and can't breathe or breathe rapidly. I have not eaten anything in 2 days and I feel like if I were to eat I would throw up.
To top it all off he also said that he was scared to break up with me because of my current suicidal thoughts. When he said this I felt horrible, I felt that even without meaning it I've been manipulating him. I feel horrible, I don't know what to do but I know for a fact that I can't go on like this. He is the only joy in my life and I think that if I were to actually lose him I wouldn't be able to cope.He told me to give him some time but I don't know if I can hold on that long. I feel like I've lost a piece of my heart. I wrote this on a whim since I don't have any friends apart from my boyfriend. Leaving aside this situation I also can't find a job because there aren't any where I'm leaving and can't afford university. I don't know what to do with my life I feel like I don't have any perspectives. All I am thinking about in the last two days are dark thoughts about how maybe harming myself will alleviate this pain which I know it won't but it seems like I can't think rationally right now."

MentalHealthUK,09/26/21 17:43:18,I'm out of options and don't know what else to do,"I've checked the local resources in this sub and can't access any of them. 

Growing up I experienced childhood sexual emotional and physical abuse as well as medical neglect. Abuse  came from my parents, teachers and peers. I moved to uni for a fresh start and it all just happened again. Domestic abuse, rape etc. 

I've lived in my current cityfor 6 years. I had  6 months of therapy which was working until they discharged me because my case worker had too many clients and wanted to free up his schedule more (this is what he told me). Between 2015 and 2019 I entered a&amp;e over 450 times after attempting to take my own life. Every time I was sent home after being shouted at for wasting people's time. Even after taking hundreds of pills I was sent home without even being physically checked over. 

I'm withdrawing from my meds because my GP won't renew my prescription. I had a 40 minute assessment with a psychiatrist who kept accusing me of exaggerating my symptoms and ended prescribing me, a recovering drug addict, meds with side effects that cause impulsive and addictive behaviour. I've had this medication before and had those side effects and I'm not willing to take them again. I was on venlafaxine which was starting to work but my GP said that he can only prescribe what the psychiatrist has suggested and called me irresponsible for not wanting to take them, even though I've tried them before and they made my drinking and drug use worse. I got told this means I'm not willing to try recovery. 

Mental health team won't see me because I'm awaiting assessment for autism and they said that means I need a mental health nurse who specialises in autism and they don't have any. They tell me just to ring the crisis team who will not speak to me. They hang up on me or tell me I am calling too much. I have been put on a list by them now which means my calls will not even be answered. They tell me if its that bad to go to a&amp;e but they won't let me in either. They tell me to go home and stop wasting resources. That a&amp;e isn't an appropriate place for me. 

I've put in 3 PALS complaints all of which have come back saying there's no evidence of any wrong doing. 

I can't cope anymore. All I think about is ending my life and I call the crisis team and they hang up on me. It feels like they're telling me to end my life. 

I am still registered with the mental health team as a  outpatient but they said they won't be offering me any support, but won't take me off their list due to ""safeguarding issues"" around my constant suicidal behaviour. So I can't access IAPT or anything. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I am completely alone. I have BPD, PTSD, OCD and possibly autism and ADHD. I also struggle with various eating disorders and am sober for a year from drugs and alcohol. I have no family as they were all abusive and I have no friends after my ex launched a smear campaign against me for breaking up with her. She would sexually and physically abuse me but told everyone I was abusive and everyone believed it because of my mental health
I csnt leave the house without being screamed at or followed by her friends. We broke up 4 years ago and she lives the other end of the country but she still has this over everyone and everyone believes it. I've lost 3 jobs because she has contacted them and said I am an abuser and I worked in safeguarding so they had to let me go. I wasn't allowed any other friends while we were together soi literally have no one. 

I cant afford private at all. I can barely afford rent right now and I'm not eligible for any benefits or financial support.

I feel like there's nothing that can be done but I don't really want to die. I just feel like there's no other option. I don't have a life. And no one will help me

There must be something I can do to get them to listen?"

MentalHealthUK,09/25/21 20:40:01,Using BUPA to cover the cost of private counselling?,"My employer offers BUPA coverage and I am looking to hear experiences from people who used this cover to pay for private counselling.

I do not have any particular conditions - I simply find counselling a helpful tool to talk through my experiences with someone at times of stress, improve my relationships and my overall wellbeing. I have seen a counsellor before for around 9 months (for general integrative counselling, not a specialist in any one therapy). A close family member recently got sick, generating some stress for the family, and would like to speak to a counsellor to unpack this.

I live in Greater London with prices for an appointment oscillating around the £60 mark or higher. My income just about too high to qualify for concessions.

I'd be keen to hear whether having seen a counsellor before would put me at a disadvantage and what BUPA's reaction may be to seeking integrative therapy without a diagnosis. I'm particularly looking to hear from people who have successfully had their sessions covered by BUPA in a similar situation (how much they pay on top of insurance, how many sessions were covered etc).

Everything is getting on top of me lately, I’ve been depressive for some time now, a while ago when I changed my number I forgot to update it with my psychiatrist so he discharged me so I currently have no professional mental health support whatsoever. There is my GP of course, but due to my Bipolar I cannot pick up that phone and make that phone call. 

The last 12 months of my life have been some of the worst, yet some of the best too (weird I know) there’s been a lot of crap so I won’t go into detail, but basically I was a victim along with my family of a serious crime, this left me homeless, me and my ex wife got divorced and I found my current partner who I’m 100% certain is my soulmate but we’re both very hot headed and feisty so I have someone who will keep me in check but it’s also the same the other way around. My eldest daughter (I have 2) is showing signs now she’s just started reception of either Post Traumatic Autism, Post Traumatic ADHD, PTSD or Autism… All of the Post Traumatic stuff is a result of the crime we were victims of and there’s a lot more that is going through my head

I am overloaded, overwhelmed and doing my absolute best to just stay alive and sane. The last 6 months I’ve come closer than ever to acting upon the thoughts in my head and everyday at the moment I’m being consumed by my mental health and getting worse and worse: it’s getting to the point where I’m tired every second of the day, I have zero energy 100% of the time and no matter how much sleep I get I never ever feel refreshed or recharged.

MentalHealthUK,09/24/21 18:29:15,Gabor Matè Training?,"Hi there,

I was just wondering if anyone could offer suggestions about a therapist or counsellor who has trained with or follows a similar technique to Gabor Matè.

The reason I’m asking for this is, my mum is a counsellor and has been for over twenty years, but has some of her own issues she needs to work out.
She has gone to other therapists in the past, but often finds it boring, she knows the techniques, knows what they will say. The last person she visited was a young woman who had graduated six months prior, not only did my mum not get anything from the session, she just kept seeing all the rookie mistakes the other person was making.

However she has been reading a lot of Gabor Matè and she likes the way he works. I’m not sure if there is something ‘better’ about his style, or if it is just newer so my mum can’t predict it so easily. Either way, she thinks she would get more out of that.

So, if I was looking to arrange a session like that, where would I go or look? Is there some sort of keyword I should use or place I should look. She’s in the UK and would probably prefer skype sessions, partly because of the pandemic but also because I doubt there is anyone local."

The doctor referred me to Camhs and after about three months they made us an appointment. They sent me these forms that i have to do which I'm little scared about. Personally I think this is a complete waste of time, I'm quite upset that I'm not dead yet, turns out dying is difficult I guess. I'm thinking of trying to die again soon but idk if I'm gonna get a good day. So I guess I want to ask some questions. 
1. What will happen if I lie on the forms?
2. What will happen if I lie at Camhs?
3. Can anyone else share their experience with Camhs? 
4. If I'm completely honest with them could I get hospitalised? (That is bad, I don't want that)

MentalHealthUK,09/24/21 06:34:28,Long term Mental Health Condition - insecure about future care.,"Reaching out to any and all who have had similar circumstances and can share wisdom and advice. 

I’ve lived with anxiety and depression from childhood - my ACE score is 6. I see a therapist twice a month to keep myself resilient and work through past and present issues. I have had 1 episode of mental health absence, despite struggling at points, in the past 2yrs. 

I have had at least 5+ major depressive/anxious episodes in my life. Intrusive thoughts, obsessive thoughts and harmful behaviours are never far away. Despite this, I’m a high functioning person and probably an over achiever. I isolate myself and find it hard to engage and keep up with friends. I want to be alone most of the time. Everyone likes me and wants to be around me but I’m dead inside. 

The only medical professional I have ever spoken to is my GP and one other terrible NHS referral with a non mental health professional where I was blamed for my condition. I’m now in a position where I am considering seeing a psychiatrist privately for official diagnosis and treatment plan. But I don’t know what to expect - I feel shame and guilt like I’m making it all up. Am I being dramatic and can they help? 

I’m coming to terms with how long I’ve lived with these illnesses and these questions are on my mind. 

I work in a hands on factory environment and I like my job. I had a massively stressful/toxic bullying event with my manager that lasted 2hrs and  it triggered panic symptoms I haven’t felt in years. The pandemic has been rough and I’ve been advised to declare a disability to talk to work about reasonable adjustments . Despite declaring my disability in my previous factory and at uni I feel shame, guilt and that I will be seen as weak for disclosing. I know this isn’t rational but I can shake the stigma."

I’ve got a mirror in my bathroom that basically whenever I look into it, I’m guaranteed to see something moving behind me.  Maybe just for a split second, but it’s movement.  At first I shrugged it off, then I got creeped out, now I just don’t care and try to spot them.

I know they’re not there, I know they’re impossible, it’s just annoying.  I go back home in a week from uni, I’ll see if it continues, I think it’s when I’m alone.  I don’t know though.

Might email my university mental health  team, but I don’t know how much help they’ll be.

I'm wondering if admitting to my boss that I sometimes suffer from anxiety may lead to me not passing the probation period.

MentalHealthUK,09/23/21 21:22:00,Just been let down by IAPT because I sought help while on the waiting list.,"After being on the IAPT waiting list for around 4 months, I had my first appointment (via phone) today, only to be told that they can't help me and have to discharge me from the system! The reason, because of the long waiting time and the state I was in I'd sought a few sessions with a therapist as a stop gap to get some help during the months long waiting period. They told me because of that they couldn't proceed with IAPT treatment and would have to discharge me.

At no point during reffering to IAPT, the consaultation call, the texts asking to fill out the monthly assessment questionaires, was it ever mentioned that if I sought external support then they wouldn't be able to proceed. 

I don't understand how the system is supposed to work. We refer ourselves to get help because we are struggling badly, it's then months of waiting, trying to cope until the first treatment appointment, but we are supposed to somehow make it through that waiting period without being able to seek any other talking support?!

MentalHealthUK,09/23/21 05:35:54,How can I get support for ARFID? (Eating disorder),"I’m 99% sure I have ARFID, an eating disorder. I have ADHD and sensory difficulties and I’ve always struggled significantly with food and finding pretty much everything disgusting. 

I feel like my anxiety has been worsening so my food habits are way off now, I can’t eat anything on most days, but I have zero issues with body image. I just don’t like most foods except maybe McDonald’s chicken nuggets, Tesco brownies, pasta with a specific kind of cheese… I can maybe eat chicken if there’s no bones around, and I can eat broccoli. In the past it’s been better but now my diet is so restrictive because I can’t handle the sensation of eating other foods. It’s like I have food anxiety. But zero issues with body image; I am confident I don’t have anorexia or another eating disorder.

Does anyone know how I can get a diagnosis and help for ARFID via the NHS? I am in London. 

Thank you."
MentalHealthUK,09/23/21 03:08:34,Don't be put off asking for help by other peoples actions,"Hi, first time posting on here :)

So today I have experienced something that I have in the past as well, but it made me think of others that things like that can traumatise and deter them from asking for help. I want to share this because I feel that people should ask for help when they need it and not allow experiences like these to put people off from accessing support or harm someone's mental or physical health.

Prank calling. Today I received two calls from a withheld number, one claiming to be a police officer telling me to stop messaging and calling reporting abuse from my partner (I have not done this and am in a healthy relationship) and another of noise complaints coming from my apartment (I live in a house, my elderly neighbour is partially deaf and we are a quiet family). As you can imagine, I was triggered and very angry and upset.

Prank calls we generally think of as funny and harmless, but it's one thing pranking saying you've got a pizza delivery and another pretending to be authorities. This isn't prank calling this is abuse. When people do this, they either don't know what traumas people have gone through and what calls like that can do to people or do it intentionally with knowledge of your life and want to harm. I've had it in the past where someone called me pretending to be a nurse saying my baby was alive, months after I suffered an mc and had another that said my mother passed away. Now having calls saying my partner is abusive and shouting at me for calling reporting abuse when I haven't isn't OK. If they had done that to someone who was experiencing abuse or a loss, that would have traumatised them and stopped them for asking for help. This is being done by so called adults and it's not okay, this is abuse.

My main point is, if any one experiences these type of things, please question if it is real, but also please don't be put off asking for help if you need it. It's awful and wrong but please make sure you look after yourself and get support from the right people. You are worth more than the negative things you experience or people throw at you ❤"
MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 23:35:02,Struggling with pressure &amp; many overlapping conditions,"I tailored off anti-depressants 2 weeks ago, and I've been an anxious ball since. And angry. I didn't like taking them, they made me sleepy. The other one I tried made me dissociate. My current state of mind is fighting to not listen to the bad thoughts.   
The doctor thinks I have social anxiety. But that's what they said anyway, back in my old GP. I was on a waiting list for intensive CBT (after a few ""normal"" cbt sessions) for it but obviously that's gone now, and I haven't asked my GP about them again. I moved cities after finishing uni.   
I got put on birth control because I suspected I have PMDD, as my condition gets a lot worse week before my period. And that has definitely helped but I've also been feeling anxious on a daily basis too.   
I have a big month coming up at work, they're adding too much pressure. The whole thing rests on my team. And we can't actually seem to do much, not me anyway. Add to that, I don't even know if I'll have work in a months time - I tried to ask on Monday but I've been ignored and we won't be back till tomorrow because of holidays. I feel like I keep messing things up and saying the wrong things. It feels like I barely keep my head above water and when you add one thing to it I just break apart.  


I'm diagnosed autistic, and I don't know if it's just the autism or more but it definitely complicates everything.   


Any suggestions, what I should do, I will be happy to listen. I'm in Bristol. I've tried 4 different meds for anxiety now. I could go back to the anti depressant I was taking but on a lower dose. I would like to try a therapist if it helps - but I don't even know where to start looking for that."
MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 23:31:57,How can I actually see a psychiatrist?,"My GP referred me to a community MH practitioner who then referred me to a MH nurse and they all suspect I have bipolar. But the MH nurse (the last in the chain) is trying to get me to go back into therapy - I’ve explained I’ve had 2 courses of CBT and 2 years of counselling and it obviously hasn’t helped (otherwise I wouldn’t still be speaking to local MH teams) but she’s adamant. What can I do to actually see a psychiatrist? It’s wasting my time and the already-stretched MH teams, and it’s making home life difficult for my partner."
MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 22:14:18,It feels like other mental conditions that aren’t anxiety or depression are ignored.,"Every time I want help it’s always for the two I just mentioned. I do have anxiety, but it’s not my primary problem. My main concern is my OCD. 

I feel that disorders like OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD etc are ignored or not talked about much."
MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 21:12:21,What do you do if a service doesn't and won't give you closure and it triggers your trauma?,"Have any of you been in this situation before or have any advice on what to do please?

I was told by a person in charge in a Primary Care mental health organisation that they cared and I was important, that they couldn't sleep at night without knowing I was okay after something happened in that service etc but then made false promises that they broke and treated me badly but there was plausible deniability in their actions. They then left me with no closure and unexpectedly cancelled a final appointment (where I was supposed to get closure) the day before putting me on the spot and giving me no real chance to remember any of the things I wanted to ask.

I tried pleading with the service afterwards for closure but they wouldn't give me it. I don't know why this person decided to cancel the last appointment when they said they cared so much and that they wouldn't give me closure no matter how much I asked and told them how much mental distress it was putting me through. Their actions just go against their words and it doesn't make sense.

I don't understand as they're supposed to help people's mental health, not put them in mental distress. They have a responsibility to vulnerable people. I can't wrap my head around why this person would do this after saying they cared so much and getting me attached and opening up to them. It feels vindictive and cruel but I'm constantly in multiple minds because I've got no closure. It's the same feeling I had when I went through narcissistic abuse before, that lack of closure making me feel so uneasy.

I feel like I'd be seen as the bad one and get in trouble if I keep trying to get closure so I'm not sure what to do. Plus I'm now discharged from their service and not a client/patient and I'm into Secondary Care services so they have no legal responsibility to do anything, even though morally it's wrong and goes against what they said when they told me they're in a ""caring profession"". They know how much it's affecting me as well but they just didn't care to give me closure.

The lack of closure is hell and giving me so much cognitive dissonance and physical symptoms because it's triggered my trauma too.

Can someone please give advice or something? What can I do here?"
MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 18:03:26,Recovery team,I might be getting referred to a recovery team. Does anyone have any idea what this means?
MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 17:47:53,What's the point?,"My local council directs everyone to Togetherall to fill the gap while they are waiting for proper help.  Today,  they've decided I'm too damaged and they don't want to know me until I'm a) more emotionally stable and b) can describe the outside support I have in place.  Support we all know can take years to materialise.
So what do you do when the signposted support washes their hands,  and at what point do you decide that you might as well just give in and prove them right by accepting the label of damaged beyond repair?"

MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 04:21:50,"I was told I may have BPD, but then a psychiatrist said it's my autism - so which is it?","Hello everyone,

I'm autistic and have OCD.  However, I'm pretty sure I have BPD as well. Quite some months ago I went to A&amp;E because my mental health was just so overwhelmingly bad and I felt like I couldn't cope. One of the nurses said that it sounds like I have BPD. However, I saw a psychiatrist about a month ago and he said it's my autism. However, I don't feel too convinced. I'll be honest, I'm not sure if autistic people are impulsive or not. However, I do fit all the criteria of BPD symptoms. Oh yeah, I'm actually under a mental health team that have no training of autism. I think the psychiatrists often palm my mental health and other things as my autism - just because then they don't have to make another diagnosis of something else.

I see the psychiatrist again in December. I just feel like all psychiatrists care about is whether you have capacity or not. Anyway, I've kind of given up on ever seeing a psychiatrist who actually cares and specialises in autism."
MentalHealthUK,09/22/21 03:19:02,Is it normal to get help so quickly on the NHS?,"Hey guys,

I have had a pretty serious mental health emergency over the past few days (severe suicidal thoughts w/ a plan, I also believed that I was being recorded by cameras).

I called the GP on Monday, she told me to call the crisis team. Within a day, I'm on medication, signed up to therapy and even have a referral to secondary mental health care (psychiatrist and care coordinator).

I know that I'll be on a waitlist but from what I've read online, it's hard to even get this much help on the NHS. Is it just a postcode lottery thing or are things improving?"

I assume people think the worst of me constantly and it’s really hard to deal with.

They say they’ll call me every week but i talk to them once a month at most.

I don’t find it helpful to talk to them. I don’t feel like i can be open about things like self harm or suicide. They keep talking about how they’re here to help with my social anxiety, but i don’t have social anxiety. I’ve tried explaining that social anxiety is not an issue for me but they don’t seem to listen. They always ask me what i want them to do for me, but i have no idea what to say to that. Our conversations last barely a couple of minutes.

I was comfortable talking to my old cpn. It’s been months with this support worker and i just don’t feel that same easiness with them. They don’t know anything about me. I don’t want to tell them this, partly because i’d feel awful but also because i don’t know if i’d get allocated someone else.

I don’t have a therapist or anything and i just need someone consistent who i feel able to talk to. I’m not sure what to do."

MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 21:03:44,"For those of you diagnosed with ailments other than depression and anxiety, or those who would want a diagnosis.","Hey everyone. I'm currently doing an access to HE course- hoping to eventually become a mental health nurse- and as part of the course I need to do some independent research. 

The topic I'm most geared towards is how diagnoses are given in mental health- the barriers that exist, regional variations, timeframes, the professionals involved, etc.

I have C-PTSD but have never gotten past the point of being diagnosed with depression/anxiety by my GP, so I'm hoping that there are diagnosed people that feel able to share their experiences. 

I'm also interested in hearing from those that would like a diagnosis other than depression/anxiety- would you know how to get a diagnosis? Have you ever been given any information on the subject? If you've actively tried to pursue diagnosis, what's your story?

At this point I'm only exploring the viability of this topic so any input won't be shared and no data will be collected. I'm just curious to know how others have been treated by the system."
MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 18:38:53,Reeling from first counselling session,"I had my first counselling session yesterday afternoon. After the initial admin (confidentiality, review, if we feel you are a risk to yourself or others, etc.…) my counsellor then said “so, what is it that you want from these sessions?” A simple question but one that I just couldn’t answer. I tried to explain to them that there is so much going on that it has all just become a messy knot of feelings, thoughts, sensations, etc.… Like a ball of scribble that has no beginning, or end. I just broke down, crying, and said that I just want to stop feeling like I don’t want to be alive anymore. I feel numb and agitated at the same time, I feel lonely, but don’t want to talk to anyone as I now don’t know how to interact with anyone without being “fake happy”. I have no plans to end my life and I have two children that are my absolute world when I see them. But the feeling on not wanting to be alive doesn’t go away. 

So, I spoke for 40 mins, going off on various tangents, reliving various childhood experiences and then, we came to the end of the session and the counsellor asked how I felt. “Drained, tearful and numb” was my response. They asked if I was in a safe place and was going to be “ok”. I said I was. I was at home, alone, and had to go back to work. When the zoom call ended, I sat, totally numb, and knowing that I had a whole week until I could talk to them again, a week of increasing anxiety over what I would say, how I would feel, etc.… I hope that this starts to help me and appreciate that this is a bit of a rambling post. I guess I wanted to vent to a group which may understand what I’m feeling. Friends’ responses to my first session were all “well, that’s good, you must feel ‘lighter’ having got it off your chest”. They mean well but it’s so hard to explain to people who are going through it or haven’t been through it. Anyway, thanks for those who have taken the time to listen.

MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 18:36:51,Brother is unable to care for himself,"Hi.

My younger brother suffered a series of psychotic breaks over the years, as well as some quite serious physical trauma in an unrelated accident.  He eventually agreed to take medication for his mental health but refuses any other counselling. This has slowly improved his behaviour and mental health. He's had on-and-off part time jobs in various parts of the country but nothing sticks.

He recently lost his part-time job in Devon where he was camping for accommodation. He's seemingly unable to hold down a job due to lack of short-term memory, very little self-care (he's very unkempt and doesn't look after himself), and his general demeanour, which is vacant, mostly emotionless, and not social.

He's just turned up at our mother's home - something he has routinely done in the past when he's  had no other options. She's just had surgery, is getting older, and simply can't afford to keep him at home, and the strain of having him at home is unbearable for her. 

He's applied for local jobs but it's highly unlikely he'll get or keep them due to the aforementioned behaviours. He can't afford to rent a room and again is unlikely to be successful in his applications due to his behaviour (most seek a 'young professional' lodger.)

He generally presents well when discussing his mental health issues with doctors and so they believe him when he says he is fine and requires no help. He won't self-admit to any mental health clinic and he is not directly a danger to himself or others and so he is unlikely to be sectioned.

Lacking any support from local mental health services, we believe our only option to secure him housing is to get him to declare himself homeless and request housing from the council, which would be traumatic and likely end up with him in some random part of Hampshire. This won't help him get a job or the general social support he needs, let alone the mental health support. 

Any thoughts, options, opinions - anything - on how to get him social support, longer-term housing, or simply a social worker who can help would be greatly appreciated. (We are currently attempting to get hold of the Mental Health Support Team in Hampshire.)"

MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 16:37:03,Just a vent while I'm at my worst,"Having the year from Hell. People say 2020 was bad, 2021 was so much worse for me.

My mental health has slipped from the beginning. My nephew was stillborn last month, I'm struggling to come to terms with that.

My best friend's brother died on Friday, and he was like a brother to me. I loved him, he was so funny. His death wasn't unexpected but it still fucking hurts. 

I can't take time off work cos my parents are currently certain that I'll get the sack if I take a sick day. But I work with assholes who rile me up all the fucking time, and when my boss gets involved, he's always bitching at me. I stopped myself from kicking off today while my colleague continued and he's ""stop acting childish, you're such a child. Not everything is end of the world just cos it is for you blah blah blah"" and I cannot take anymore.

I have job instability too. My apprenticeship provider have gone bust and I don't know what's going to happen.

My mental health is so fucking low right now. I referred myself for therapy again, it's at least three weeks for a call back, but I don't even think I'll make it there. 

I don't have a safe place, I don't have anyone to talk to and there's nothing I can do anymore."
MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 16:13:32,GP waiting times.,"I have had the worst three weeks in regards to my mental health. It has not been like this for a year. I put a request for an appointment with a GP. But they classified it as non urgent and I may get seen in 10 days.

Is there anyone that I can talk to about my mental health faster than that? Has anyone had any experience with private GPs? I don’t think I can hold on for 10 days. 
Thanks"
MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 16:09:46,How to actually speak to a psychiatrist?,"I asked my GP for a referral to a psychiatrist due to over a decade of suicide attempts and constant MH issues. I had a telephone consultation yesterday and they said they'd look at my meds. Confirmed today they have not got me down to speak to a psychiatrist even though I was told they thought it was worth me being investigated for BPD/BP/schizophrenia and now instead just told me to ""see how things go"". 

I am absolutely distraught. I know I have severe mental health issues, yesterday it sounded like someone finally believed me and now I'm right back where I was except with a slightly higher dosage of meds I'm already on like I keep building tolerance to. 

I just want to get a diagnosis and get the support I need. I'm not just depressed, there's something serious going on and I'm just being brushed off again. I'm about ready to isolate myself from everyone forever now and know I'm too broken to live a normal life"
MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 06:47:51,How can you open up to mental health services if you're afraid they could use the info to covertly abuse you in the future?,"I'm afraid of opening up and sharing my triggers, trauma and everything else that I'm experiencing with the Secondary Services people that I've just started with just in case in the future they passive-aggressively use the info to covertly abuse me and trigger me in the future if I do something they feel is wrong.

This sort of happened at a previous service in Primary Care which caused me so much prolonged mental distress that felt like torture. So that' why I'm so wary of it as anything I say can be used against e one way or another. How can you gauge if the people there, like the mental health nurses etc, genuinely have your best interests at heart and aren't there just for the sake of ""society"" to get potentially mentally unwell people off the streets or something?

Has anyone felt similar things to me and can relate? Or does anyone have any advice please?"
MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 03:21:16,Psychiatrist recommendations?,"Hello,

My husband has been struggling very intensely over the past 3 years. He was diagnosed with ADHD at 32 but he feels that his symptoms are very similar to those of ADHD but have been fuelled primarily by his extremely traumatic childhood (the trauma and unhealthy environment went well into his teenage years). e.g. he was not allowed to go outside until he was 15, if not older (it only happened on a VERY few occasions), so he thinks that the constant pacing (commonly associated with ADHD) may be actually his response to this restriction, if that makes sense (e.g. as a healthy, energetic child, he can't go outside so he channels his energy into pacing about conitnually). So it may not be ADHD, but trauma... and perhaps something else.

However, the problem is he needs someone to listen to him properly, to allow him to tell his full story, and who is really good at what he does. The psychiatrist we've seen privately was a greedy bastard and the NHS psychiatrist couldn't even remember the side effects of Vyvanse when asked about them. They're VERY ill qualified to help!

Who knows, maybe he needs completely different meds, but without speaking to a psychiatrist who can really help and understand... it's impossible to tell.

Any recommendations please? We can afford to pay a bit more than the £150 usual consultation fee. We're in Durham, but online video appointments would be much better as my husband's never feeling up to anything anyway.

Many, many thanks!"
MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 01:20:09,Promising support option in London (for suicidal feelings) - The Listening Place,"Hi all,

I've posted a lot previously venting about my struggles and negative experiences with a lot of support/crisis lines/webchats, waiting lists for IAPT etc, so just wanted to share a bit more of a positive experience I've had with this support place in London incase it helps anyone else.

The place is [The Listening Place](https://listeningplace.org.uk/) , you're best reading up on them direct from their site or getting in touch directly, but quick summary: They have two locations in London, both quite central to get to (one near Kings Cross, the other in Pimlico), and they offer free face-to-face support for anyone struggling with sucidial feelings (6 fortnightly sessions). Just be aware they aren't a crisis support, they are there for the prolonged struggling/build up of suicidal feelings. I first saw it mentioned in a comment to a thread on here a while back (sorry I can't find the post/user to credit). 

My experience with them so far: 

The last few weeks I've been getting a lot worse still, with increasing levels of suicidial feelings / lack of will to live, not feeling like I was at immediate risk or would make a snap descision, more the feeling that it will be an inevitable outcome at some point as I can't see a way out of what I'm going through. I got in touch with The Listening Place earlier this week, I self reffered via their website Wednesday, they phoned the next day to have a chat about my situation and booked me in for a consultation/initial chat to discuss things in more detail, I had that appointment today. The initial discussion I had today was partly for them to explain more in depth how they support (mainly as the name suggests by just being there to listen, they don't judge or advise on things etc), and to talk about what I was going through, relevant background to the situation etc. They said no infomation is passed to any other parties, and notes kept are quite minimal (mainly just enough so if the volunteer you see is off sick/on holiday and you see another then they'll have some idea without you repeating it all). What they said is mainly they try to act as a support bridge, and at the end of the appointments there's a sort of debrief appointment where they can go over any key things that have come out from the chats, and hopefully from those they can point me to places for the next stage of support. They booked up the 6 appointments for me at the end too (first of which is next week), so no long waiting list to find out when they can fit you in.

It's still early of course for me as my first session will be next Monday, and they did advise me that the first session might feel quite similar to what I went over today, as it'll be a case of explaining my situation and feelings directly to the volunteer so they can get a better understanding of me and the situation, rather than just from the notes. After that though they said they try to keep you with the same volunteer for consistency and being able to feel comfortable with the same person (unless they are on holdiay/off sick etc). But so far it really does feel like this place is going to be more helpful to me than any other resource I've tried. It didn't feel like chats I've had at other places where it felt I was being passed through a checklist or conversational flow chart, I actually felt they were there to help (the consaultant also assured me they don't have those types of systems).  

Maybe I'll post back in a few weeks to give an update how I'm getting along there, but it certainly feels hopeful so far. So thank you whoever it was that mentioned it previously. If anyone is in the London area and going through a similar struggle with suicidal feelings building up then I'd say it'd certainly be worth getting in touch with them.

\*note for mods, I've tagged it as resources, but sorry if that's not quite the relevant tag then let me know and I'll change it."
MentalHealthUK,09/21/21 00:13:39,Trying to not be so much of a recluse and working on not letting my anxiety stop me from doing things but it has immediately gone to shit,"I recently joined a committee (wanted to take the opportunity to meet new people and challenge myself with socialising and it would give me a reason to go out atleast once a week) and as part of my role I was asked to apply for something for an event. However the questions on the form were not questions i could answer. Some questions were about previous years and since i have only joined this year i don't know the answers, and some where about the event we are applying to this thing for and because its not my job to organise the event i don't know the answers to those questions either.

&amp;#x200B;

So i posted the questions into the groupchat with other committee members who do/should know the answers and asked for their advice. This was over two days ago and despite everyone having seen my message within hours of sending it, nobody has responded to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously my first though was, 'Oh god they all hate me, dont they', then i tried to be more rational. Prehaps they have just been busy and havent had the time. but then somebody posted a question earlier today and it was answered within minutes of people seeing it. so now i'm back to 'Oh god they hate me'.

&amp;#x200B;

So i dont know what to do now, because i have to apply for this thing but i cant cos i don't know any of the answers to the questions being asked. And i dont want to seem pathetic and ask the group again, and i don't want to come across and begging or needy"
MentalHealthUK,09/20/21 21:22:07,"LPT Avoidance ,Escapism in Life","I have to push myself alot to get into doing, for every single thing. 
My default response to everything is avoidance, escapism. All the day to day life activities I want to avoid. I have even changed careers , pursuing career aligned to my passions but even that I have force myself.I don't know what life really is. 
Is this just bad habits/laziness or something else ?"
MentalHealthUK,09/20/21 19:36:17,I don't feel capable of working,"TLDR: While my anxiety has improved, I really struggle with extreme anxiety around going to work. I've started a new, better job and that hasn't helped, so now I just feel incapable/incompetent. What can I do?

I have ADHD (combined type), struggle with GAD and have previously experienced Depression on and off over the years. I completed a course of high-intensity CBT a few months back, which had a massive impact on the GAD side of things - I just didn't really feel anxious any more, and when I did I was able to just accept the feeling and move on. Wasn't that a nice time?

I think over the past year, I've had real issues with work, but not because of work. I'd worked a number of jobs and always felt competent, even if there was stuff I didn't like or feel as confident about. I don't know what happened in the late half of 2020 that changed things, I just know things changed. I started feeling pure dread and panic about going to work, the full day before and the morning of. I called in ""sick"" a lot (I don't know how to share that this is mental health stuff without over sharing with managers, I felt weird about ""lying"" but didn't see an alternative that I was comfortable with), I had a pretty nasty panic attack one day after work even though I remember nothing particularly bad happening that day. 

I thought one of my problems was my work commute which took over an hour, and this year I moved to within 15 mins walking distance of my work. It certainly made life better and easier, but it didn't necessarily affect my work anxiety. I thought another problem was the single member of staff in my workplace who treated people like garbage - she had been our stand-in manager while our actual line manager was on maternity leave, I'd started as soon as she'd left and not met her but working under somebody I could actually talk to made the world of difference... but, again, didn't really affect the work anxiety I was experiencing.

Other than CBT, the only thing that did help was handing in my notice (as I'd had another job offer). That last week was a breeze.

Now I've started my new job, which is very different and in lots of good ways - contracted hours after a zero hours job, better pay, a smaller venue and team making something genuinely amazing, passionate people, extensive training... but one of the few things I don't have is comfort with people here. The owners and the colleagues are LOVELY, don't get me wrong, but I was working with people I felt close to before, and now I'm with people I don't see myself being close to. My first shift felt full of panic, and even though realistically it was only a third of the shift that was actually hectic, I still walked away feeling terrible and sobbed as soon as I got home.

I work in hospitality and have always had customer-facing jobs. I've always loved what I do and been told I'm good at it, and felt that too. Right now, I don't see or feel any of it, and if I can't be good at the one thing I thought I had going for me (being good with people) then I feel like... what can I even do?

I just feel totally incapable to the point of pure panic. Yes, I know in reality I get the job done and none of this turmoil is really seen by customers or co-workers, and I'm overthinking and worrying, but even when I don't worry and I'm actually just working and nothing is going wrong but things are overwhelming (in a very normal working sense), I feel like I just collapse. I can't deal with pressure anymore, even though I used to deal with pressure so well. I don't know what happened.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I probably need a lot more mental health support that's actually consistent, or need somebody to assess if I have other undiagnosed conditions, but the only people I know who've received that kind of support have repeatedly been in hospital, dealt with Crisis Teams a lot, etc. The one time I thought I needed to be hospitalised and contacted the Crisis Team, I found them kinda belittling and they also didn't actually do anything they said they'd do. I feel like I'm not a ""serious"" enough case for them, but am way too much for any other options. I don't wanna die but dear god I don't wanna be here/me either.

I don't think talking to my work so early on in being there is gonna do anything but give a poor impression of me. I haven't actually signed up to a GP since I moved so doing that and getting help there will take time, and that's if they do anything. I wish I could just not work but I need to financially survive. I don't know anymore."
MentalHealthUK,09/20/21 17:18:43,Low mood as of recently.,"29M Scotland.

As someone who is normally healthy, I have been getting migraines for the past 2 weeks and a pain in my right knee for 3 months. I have a history of migraines and was prescribed Amitryptiline, but they make me super drowsy in the morning even if I take them before bed.

The GP was hopeless about it all. My knee he said may be arthritis forming and for both things he prescribed me 500mg Paracetomel. Basically I went to the GP to be prescribed something I can get out of Lidl for 30p. 

It's screwing with my head. I have low mood, low motivation and I am worried. To the point that I am forcing myself to work. 

I have been on Sertraline Hydrochloride for the past 2 years and they help.

Any advice on what I can do?"
MentalHealthUK,09/20/21 10:52:48,How can I (24f) diminish the negative effects my mental issues on those around me?,"I’m starting to see how my personal issues and low self esteem is affecting not only me but others around me, from friends to coworkers to family (I don’t have an SO and don’t want one right now). At the same time, I’m growing more and more “desperate” for connection after years of sort of socially isolating myself.

I think my anxiety in particular becomes tiresome to others, as does my constant apologizing for minor things. I’m the same vein, some other things people have commented on as bothering them: being too accommodating, automatically assuming I’m at fault or in trouble all the time, being passive and “people pleasing” (always trying to mind read and align my desires and opinions with others). Throughout my life multiple people (mostly family, teachers and bosses) have said (usually in a kind way) that I sometimes make them feel like a ""tyrant,"" because I am so fearful and apologetic and subservient. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many other things that people have gently pointed out.

How can I stop myself from impacting others negatively in this way? How can I be more self aware of my impact?"
MentalHealthUK,09/20/21 09:50:52,"For anyone under 35, or who cares for someone under 35, I personally recommend Papyrus HOPELINE","HOPELINE is a service you can call, text or email from 9am-midnight every day of the year if you're struggling with suicidal thoughts or know someone who is. 

https://www.papyrus-uk.org/hopelineuk/

Call: 0800 068 4141

Text: 07860039967

Email: pat@papyrus-uk.org

I know there's a lot of stigma and negative experiences with services like this, and often it feels like they aren't equipped to deal with people who are in crisis. Often all they can do is listen, it might feel like they don't really understand, or that they can't do anything to help you. 

So I just wanted to share my experience with HOPELINE because they are an exception, and they are a wonderful service with professionals trained specifically to help people with suicidal thoughts.

I've struggled with my own mental health for a long time, but I also used to be very close to someone with borderline personality disorder. She would have crises often where she'd become very emotional and impulsive, and she wanted to hurt or kill herself. She got very close to doing it sometimes, and I think if I hadn't been there to intervene she might have done. I can't put into words how intense these situations sometimes were.

Whenever she interacted with anyone trying to help her with her mental health - her GP, the crisis team, the CMHT, the Samaritans - she often ended up feeling worse. She felt like they didn't really understand how bad she felt and how urgently she needed help. She felt like they best they could do was listen, or maybe offer some advice that wasn't appropriate when she was feeling as bad as she was. She was often left feeling very hopeless and like nobody could help her, and she couldn't see a way out.

She became more and more reluctant to engage with any help. This was very stressful for me too, because it meant I had to deal with these crises alone.

One day I managed to convince her to call HOPELINE. I don't know what they said but she was on the phone for a while and it was amazing because they actually managed to calm her down and get through the worst of the crisis, and put a plan in place for the next time she was feeling like that. They made some notes on what they talked about so next time she called they'd know a bit about her and want she was going through so she wouldn't have to explain everything again. They gave her some practical advice so she could see a way for things to get better.

After the call she felt calmer, safer and more hopeful. She also felt like she would ring them again if she ever felt the same way. It was a huge weight off my shoulders too because I knew now she had someone to go to in a crisis, and I could trust that they'd keep her safe. 

I never called them myself. I don't really know why but I wish I had, because they also support people who are caring for people with suicidal thoughts and I think they could probably have helped me to deal with it too.

They can also support professionals (in education, healthcare, emergency services, charity, etc.) who work with young people and have concerns about them feeling suicidal.

I've rambled a bit but I just really wanted to emphasise that this is an amazing service and in my experience they've been able to help in horrible situations where nobody else can. The compassion, understanding and expertise they show has genuinely been a lifesaver.

So for anyone who's really struggling and feels like they can't access the help they need or the services they've tried don't help, please consider giving them a call (or  text or email).

And for people who are in the situation I was in, feeling overwhelmed, helpless and upset trying to help someone going through this, I'd also recommend them to you.

MentalHealthUK,09/20/21 09:16:39,Putting walls up and bringing them down to get let down?,"A couple weeks ago walked out my job (getting bullied, willful complacency from mgmt/hr, unresolved and continuing harassment) with no plan but the place broke me mentally, I don't know what happened to be honest.  Everything just went up like security doors in a bank.  Couldn't reply to friends/colleagues when they asked what was up. One I'm close with kinda started getting frustrated with me and all I could say is that 'I don't know what to say, I had no words.' and it was the honest truth.    


I just don't know what's going on with me.  Sims been out the phone, only going to the shop if completely necessary and when it's dark something has snapped in me.  I know the right thing to do is phone the GP but I wont cos it's take your pills and listen/touch stuff which doesn't really cut it with me so that just seems like a dead end. Occ health are phoning me on tuesday which should be interesting once I unload everything on them so not really looking forward to that but kinda am because work has seriously let me down big style.  I'm fairly certain I could win a case against them.  I'm down as unauthorised absence but they can sack me I'm really not interested or about to gain any interest.  Self destruct mode.  


Anyway, it's all like that just now but something I've noticed is how quiet my phone is.  I got in touch with that close friend and I was like can I come for coffee and she said yes I'll text you when you can come round but she ended up going out with her parents for lunch because she got a new job so I was kinda left hanging.  The selfish side of me is saying yo im suicidal mate that kinda sucks what you did but also she's got a new job and she's excited so fair play to her but I feel like such a dick for thinking like this.  Kinda see it as petty revenge because I was ignoring her texts but that just makes me a shitty friend/person.  I've just got nowhere to turn and I dont know what to do.  Even right now I'm writing this debating if I should just ctrl x it because who cares really.  I must be an awful person.  It probably sounds like I'm not taking resposibility for being distant with people but I am, I know I didn't deserve the coffee because of that but it's kinda hurting all the same.  


Plus everything else that's wrong aswell its gotten too much lately.  


I'm just...if someone has been in a similar situation or has felt like this, like something happens and you just throw your hands up in the air with no regard for the consequences I don't really know what happened.  Like I'm feeling really weird, I don't want to say too much in case I'm judged for it.... I don't know sometimes it helps knowing other people have gone through similar things and hearing their experience, I guess this is what I'm after if you don't mind.  It's just a bundle of everything and I am extremely overwhelmed just now.  I'm meant to be a 40 year old man lmao."
MentalHealthUK,09/19/21 07:01:01,Rejected by the cmht for the second time,"First time was in April I was forwarded by the gp. I got a single letter saying they wouldn’t take any action. I tried contacting them but none of their phone numbers actually went to them. I rang first response several times and they wrote an email to cmht asking for them to speak with me, they never responded, even after the first response manager reforwarded the email

Their explanation was that I hadn’t tried enough medications and I should engage with my well-being (which I had done but they said they couldn’t offer me what I was looking for and they discharged me)

So gp increased my medication and I tried my well-being again. They offered me phone counselling but I had to wait for it. Fast forward a couple of months and I had this phone counselling. Spoke to them and after 2 sessions she recommended forwarding me to cmht for my problems and stopped the sessions

I waited. Cmht said they assess me, I waited a month for assessment. The woman I spoke to recommended I get a diagnostic assessment. She referred me. I waited 3 weeks

They said ‘sounds like depression’ and told me to go back to the gp again

MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 23:25:38,"38m Bipolar uk, Manic episode and now I have really screwed up. Advice?","Long story.

I have been diagnosed bipolar for about 10 years and the last 4 years have been fairly stable. That was up until April this year. My wife, who is a massive support suffered a scare which was extremely stressful. On top of that, the whole covid thing with home schooling... plus a job that requires me to be up by 1.30am started to cause me to wobble.

I could see the signs something was about to happen. I was getting extremely agitated and irritable. Falling out with people at work over the smallest of things. Not sleeping. Pacing about the house for no reason.

On contacting the G.P, I was prescribed a couple of weeks worth of benzos on a couple of occasions, which worked about as great as a plaster over a severed artery. But I didn't want anything to heavy as I was in the process of getting my license renewed and didn't want anything to effect the outcome.

BIG MISTAKE.

And this is where it gets crazy and becomes a real shit storm.

I noticed that private conversations I was having with my wife in our own home (mostly bedroom with window open), or times when I was acting up, was somehow getting back to work.

A couple of days later colleagues would repeat something I had said in a sarcastic manner. Or in a way to try and make me paranoid. Well that worked extremely well. 

I started to suspect that my wife wasn't being loyal and started to give her shit. And the more I gave her shit, the more work would intensify.

It all came to a head a few weeks ago when at 2am, I went into a manic rage and accused my wife of having an affair, and not only that... But she was plotting with work to get me the sack so she could kick me out. (Fuck me)

The extreme delusional thinking has now come back to haunt me. As I said some pretty graphic nasty things out of spite and guess what... It got back to work and now the entire place is giving me subtle shit to try and make my paranoia worse. Its then I started to realise that it wasn't my wife at all, but the spinster neighbour who had been listening in to everything we have been saying and doing for the last 4 months. And when I say everything.... I mean everything.

They have recently just moved and she decided to leave us a letter just as she was leaving, saying that she has never experienced such an unhappy family and that we basically mistreat our children. But not once did she ever come round to say we were making them unhappy. She also didn't count on my wife storming after her and confronting her.

I am guessing she has told everyone in the street and anyone else who will listen how much of a monster I am and how unhappy our family are. As everywhere I go, I am now getting looks or remarks.

Its even got as scary that she may have connections to my place of work and has been feeding information not only about my mental health but also what me and my wife do in our own home.

This has lead to an almighty crash when I was put on quetiapine to bring me down. I have been stuck in my house for 2 weeks not wanting to go out or face anyone. Good bye driving license.

The problem I have, is that I now believe there are a few people who were getting this info and then purposely trying to feed my paranoia and the delusion that my wife was being disloyal.

I also feel like I was being watched and followed, waiting for me to make a fatal mistake to get me out the door.

This whole thing is so messed up. There is literally no way for me to prove what has happened as everyone can now say i'm crazy, unstable etc.

I just can't believe that there wasn't even one person who could pull me to one side and say that something wasn't right.

I guess after all this rambling mess, i'm just after some advice.

Would you take it further? Should I just let it go and hope it dies out in time. I just feel that this has been a massive invasion of my privacy and what I say and do in my own home should stay there.

Also, if she had real concerns about me or the safety of my family? why not contact social services or even the police. I had nothing to hide.

I accept I have to take responsibility for my actions. No illness is an excuse for shitty behaviour. But I feel I have been stitched up big time."

I don't like how I'm feeling and would hate to go through this for weeks, should I halve the dosage to 25mg instead of 50? I'm feeling super drowsy right now. I have to get into bed because it makes me feel so low and then I get depressed."
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 22:21:14,I feel like I’m lying about my life,"16M (UK) I just started college, I’m stressed and tired and all around overwhelmed. I can’t stand it, my mum keeps asking me if I had a good day at college if I say anything else other than it was good she thinks there’s something wrong with me. She doesn’t believe in mental health problems and kept asking my brother what’s wrong with his life when he was diagnosed with anxiety. 

I hate studying I don’t know anything about my future stop saying I should plan ahead, but then saying you should spend all your time studying, I just want to have some fun and not spend everyday studying. I lose motivation and my life just keeps going down a pit of depression and anxiety about the next day.

I’m lonely I just can’t seem to find a girlfriend I haven’t dated anyone since Year 9 I haven’t even had my first kiss yet. Just as I find a girl l like one of my “friends” tells the girl I like her, mind you I didn’t even tell the friend I liked her it’s was just a baseless rumour but since I wear some emotions on my sleeves it’s obvious and I can’t deny it, I just got her snap as well and now it feels like I’m never gonna talk to her again and since I’m socially awkward my life just feels ruined 
and I don’t know what to do and now I don’t even know who to trust. Which is why I’m venting on Reddit.

I think about dying a lot, I know it’s dark but I sometimes I just want to know how it feels to not have to care anymore to not be stressed to finally be free from my anxiety from my loneliness.

Thanks for reading I just really needed to get this out tbh."
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 19:34:20,Signed off sick,"I am so so tired of being off work and feeling useless. I hate telling people when asked ""so what do you do for work?"".

I was told I should take time off sick by my old CPN, 3 years ago, when OCD-like symptoms were taking over at the job I had at the time (since corelated to an ASD diagnosis). I've tried to work since then but failed each time, either crippled by paranoia before and during work and catching myself self harming without really realising, on the job. These were only 16hr jobs, I had an entire week to myself to prepare each time but instead it would just destroy my entire week.

Before, I was working full time, had my own horse etc. I have no idea what happened.

I feel like absolute shit for how long I've been off, especially as I now have my own flat and dog. I spend my entire days keeping busy and distracted which seems to look like I'm doing ""okay"" to everyone around me, when in reality I do all these things alone because I can't cope around people, and I'm really just trying not to let my mind wander and sink. 

I have an old friend who was sectioned following addiction, she was of course off for this time, too, but she's also back to living her life within a 2 year period. I'm so happy for her but I'm also so sad. I'm literally begging for therapy to be told I'm too unstable yet I've been with the local mental health team my entire adult life (18 - 22 at current) and there still seems to be absolutely no hope, and it doesn't make sense that in 10 years of poor mental health, I've been stable enough to discharge but never be offered actual treatment?

I wouldn't even consider self harm and feeling suicidal unstable for me, its normal after this long.

I just want to be happy and proud of myself, so so badly."
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 08:44:41,im getting so frustrated with the lack of help.,"excuse the lack of capitalisation - its 2am and im having a breakdown.

i'm a 22 year old diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. it's a very damaging mental condition and cripples me almost daily, the symptoms being awful panic attacks, mood swings, feeling manic, incredibly suicidal with a moments notice. i saw a stat that 10% of people with bpd take their life and sadly, i have nearly 5/6 attempts - 2 in the last year and all others before the age of 20.

i have been on the waiting list for therapy for ages now. this year, i got referred to mind, who are absolutely  U S E L E S S. they messed up my admin side, saying i was a mother ? i am not. this was in march. we are in september and i've had maybe 1 phone call from an incredibly rude receptionist who rejected my application because i was happy on the phone. i went to a&amp;e that night because i tried to kill myself. i waited for hours just to be given some numbers who didnt even pick up the phone. 

bpd is ruining my life. im on meds and yes, it helps my anxiety symptoms to some extent but its ruining everything else. 

i graduated last year in a pandemic and got a 2:1 on my media dissertation, which i'm very proud of, but my parents seem to think it would let me walk straight into a journalist job in a luxury office in london. i thought i would have moved out by now. i've only just got a job in retail because the job pool was so hard to fight (300 people applied for a single job at my local post office). 

it feels like screaming into the void and no one is helping. just when it's too late. and it's terrifying. im not even 2 weeks into staying clean from self harm and i feel so on edge and shit. 

i dont know what to do."
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 07:37:38,Random urge to self harm,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am safe and I am not suicidal. I’m just curious to know if this is something others experience? 

I feel things for me are stable and going in the right direction. I’m still struggling with motivation and depressive traits like poor hygiene etc. But overall it is better than what I had been in the past. 

I was uploading a picture online and noticed my faint scars from the previous time I self harmed and I got this overwhelming urge to do it again. It just came to me and felt like such a casual thing. What is that about? 

I’ve been suicidal. I know what it feels like. I’m just a bit baffled as to why this urge has come on and I do not feel any distress or emotion towards it. I wanted to do it. Like it would be a casual thing. 

Do I make any sense? Or is this just a red flag that I’m imminently going to start snowballing down a relapse?

Thanks folks, any words of advice would be appreciated."
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 07:20:20,Should I fight for psychotherapy on the NHS?,"Dear reader, I'm just asking for your opinion I've been struggling with OCD/Anxiety &amp; Depression, ever since the first lockdown. I self-referred myself to a mental health service locally, part of the NHS. I'm sure anyone familiar mental health services in the London/UK, good therapy is hard to come by.I was very fortunate that they put me through a CBT based therapy during the second lockdown, at this time I was living in a homeless shelter and was under immense pressure with the living standards.Despite being supported by a clinical psychologist, I left feeling disappointed - especially because I was lied to about the duration of the therapy, (she said I can have as long as I need to overcome ruminating, then ended the therapy 1 or 2 sessions after). I felt her therapy wasn't applicable to me given the stressful events I've had at 23 years old. I thought that she wasn't able to compartmentalise my social phobias, or understand that OCD Rumination was only a fraction of what's going on.

But now I managed to get housed, I've been living in my flat for 6 months, I thought it would be a drastic life changer and motivator for me but I'm still suffering from low-self esteem, repetitive thoughts and rerunning scenarios (catastrophising), and other emotional/behavioural issues. This is making finding a partner, keeping friends and getting into work really challenging. When I approached an alternative, NHS mental health service again, they arranged for pre-assessments with the doctor (psychiatrist). The doctor explained that since the Covid lockdown the demand for therapy is so high that I will have to wait 2 years to see someone. As a result, they are under-staffed and underfunded.

Also, that because I'm a young adult, that after the 2 year wait, they will have to re-refer me to the adult service at 25. I'm worried that they are playing a tactic and trying to divert me away from the service. A part of me thinks I'm becoming to reliant on therapy to cope, another feels impatient, let down by the quality of NHS mental health services. I'm shocked that the Dr suggested I go private, when I'm unemployed because of mental health. I said that if need be, I can complain to my Local Member of Parliament to challenge the waiting times and quality of care. The Doctor told me not to complain because that would get the service into trouble. So far, I think I'm being given a false sense of security by this mental health centre. I want to know what your take on this is? Whether I should take it to my Local MP or not?

I don't exactly want to ruin things with the Dr, but I need this help. As I have a low quality of life and just want to carry on and do the normal things young people do.

\*Please be kind on the post, thanks for reading :-)"
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 06:03:50,What would happen if I walk into A&amp;E and tell them I’m suicidal?,I really need help. I can afford to wait months to see a professional under the NHS and I can’t afford private healthcare.
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 03:30:09,Has anyone had an NHS Social Prescribing Link Worker? What are your experiences?,"I've apparently been given one to offer support but I don't know who's referred them and what the reason was for it.

Have any of you had a ""Social Prescribing Link Worker"" from the NHS work with you and what was the experience like?

What could it mean regarding your mental health if one is referred to you to help support you? Like does it mean they (the GP PRactice or whoever referred them to you) think there's something serious or anything like that with you?

There's a general info page on it on the NHS site but I'm wondering what your experiences with them are and what they do. Thanks for any input."
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 02:56:23,I want to die so I don't feel like this,But I won't do anything to make that happen and I'll just go on feeling like this until my pointless existence on this planet comes to it's natural end :) yay life
MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 02:48:51,Adult mental health care doesn't exist,"During childhood i was abandoned by both parents on multiple occasions and lived latter part of childhood in foster care then after service until 21. Since then i lived completely alone and isolated. I had CAMHS referrals throughout childhood, i was suppose to have an Autism assessment at 14 but never happened cos kept on moving.  I went to five primary schools and four secondaries. 

I am constantly self Harming, there is a restraining order against me from my own father who i last saw when i was 17. I am currently homeless in emergency accommodation, my 30th birthday is next month and considering ending it then.

I have had no therapy or any sort of mental health care because of my childhood, instead i get punished and bullied for it.

MentalHealthUK,09/18/21 00:15:16,I feel like my friends hate me. I should talk to them but their problems are so much worse.,"I've been getting very anxious recently and feeling as though my best friends (who are my flatmates) hate me. I try so so hard in sociable situations to be kind and normal but it never seems to make a difference. I went on a few self help websites and so many suggest talking to my them about my worries and disgussing why i feel this way. However, this year has been so tough for them. The person who this is worst with just lost her Dad in january, and has had the worst year of her life. When people have brought up their problems around her, she has this ""sorry but your problems are nothing compared to mine"" attitude, which I honestly can't disagree with. I basically just want to find a way to raise my self esteem, as i know this is all in my head, and i don't want to make it other people's problem."
MentalHealthUK,09/17/21 21:35:28,My first day of Sertraline,"So I've taken this around 12:30 today and within maybe 5 minutes I felt a tiny boost in energy and felt like I could focus and then afterward I started to feel really low and I feel quite low right now, as in, depressed. I could sleep as of right now and I probably will because the feelings of depression have become intense after taking this."
MentalHealthUK,09/17/21 18:58:34,"Partner blames all their problems on me, won't seek support... I'm losing it","My partner and I have had a tumultuous relationship since a breakdown triggered by a work event a few years ago. I knew their mental health had been up and down before we met, but our first years together were mostly happy. 

The breakdown was followed by a period of me working more than full time while keeping the home together. They received treatment and some support - but not enough. There was never any real question of me offering them support beyond taking over the practicalities at home - they adamantly refused any meaningful conversation and consistently held me at arm's length. I always tried to be there for them, though. 

Their anger and frustration was frequently taken out on me, but they didn't acknowledge it. They had become negative and would criticise my weight, hair, clothes, cooking, and sexual performance. Every day they would nitpick and think up yet another way in which I had managed to ruin their day/week/life. The smallest inconvenience would be a crisis and trigger for grumpy and passive aggressive behaviour. 

But through it all, one particularly disturbing pattern started to show - while they could be cold and cruel towards me, with other people they would shift completely, be overly polite, friendly and chatty - the person I longed for - only to then shift back again once alone with me. It sometimes felt like they were two entirely different people. 

With time they seemed to get better, but I was a wreck after almost two years of emotional abandonment and frequently taking the blame for everything. Worryingly, as their mood started to shift to the better, they completely denied that they had ever said or done any of the above - and I felt like I was losing my sanity. 

I tried to just go along with it and pretend like everything was fine - enjoying the good times while they lasted, and stubborning through the subsequent relapses. It was an emotional rollercoaster - and I had my own problems to deal with, too, but I was alone with those always. I tried my best to keep everything inside and not show them my struggles, and fought to not grow resentful. I went to therapy for a while to cope with the pressure of living with them during the difficult times, and I found it helpful, although it did not solve our problems. I chose therapy over speaking to family or friends as I didn't want anyone to worry - nor did I want them to see my partner in a negative light. It was always my opinion that they didn't choose to be ill and that things would get better when they got better. 

When COVID hit, things took a turn for the worse. As a key worker I was barely home and suffered through an incredibly difficult time at work. During the hard times they were always critical and condescending about my line of work, making comments about how I don't earn and contribute enough, and that my degree is useless - during the first breakdown they banned any talk of work at home, so they barely know what I do for a living now, after a few job changes. Still, I foolishly thought that maybe with them working from home, barely having enough to do to fill half a day, they could step up and take over running the household while I navigated lockdown Britain. But every week I would come home to piles of dishes and laundry, a filthy bathroom, no groceries, and their persistent negativity. After 16 hour work days at the height of the COVID crisis, I found myself spending my limited spare time queuing in the streets to buy tins of food. 

Sitting at home playing video games most of the day, they grew more and more depressed, to the point of not wishing to speak to me or spend any amount of time with me - when I eventually did come home from work, it was to a wall of silence and avoidance. 

Another full-blown breakdown followed around Christmas, and I suddenly recognised the signs of psychosis - they were unhinged, paranoid, accusatory, thought they were being persecuted, victimised, terrorised, and trapped. I couldn't get them the help they needed, and they adamantly refused to engage with any services. During one clear moment they told me they were depressed and disassociating, but they quickly slipped back into darkness, not acknowledging reality. 

Once again their version of reality was that everyone around them - mainly me - was at the core of all their problems and if I would just stop triggering them, they would be fine. With absolutely everything being a trigger for anxiety and paranoia, though, I started walking on egg shells around them yet again, fearing another outburst if I made even the slightest mistake. My life became completely controlled by their moods. One of the angriest and most terrifying meltdowns came about due to me asking if they'd like a cup of tea... There was no way I could speak to them about their feelings or behaviours as they interpreted any questions - such as ""How are you?"" - as interrogation and cross examination. 

When they were this anxious, they used overly dramatic and catastrophic language - if you slightly messed up, they would use words like ""destroy"" or ""ruin"". Even their body language was overly dramatic - they would stomp across rooms and pull so hard at doors that handles broke. They would walk right up to you in a huff and loudly say ""EXCUSE ME"", not leaving you enough space to get out of their way, causing them to barge past before you had time to react. 

Since this second breakdown, now with us both working from home, things have become intolerable. Since February they have been back to overreacting to minor inconveniences, being constantly grumpy, and easily triggered. Any minor issue must be blamed on someone, because they can't accept that things sometimes just happen for no reason. They exaggerate even the smalles negative to the point of absurdity - a ten minute casual Zoom call with a colleague becomes a two hour torture session. I have stopped speaking to them unless spoken to first, for fear of being angrily accused of constantly interrupting, thus ruining their concentration (I don't know what they are concentrating on as they don't appear to do much with their time) - I barely use the living room now, as one of their demands is that no one can be behind them while they're at their desk, but this is impossible due to the way the furniture is set up. This could be changed, of course - a simple, practical solution - which they have adamantly refused to engage with, saying they don't have the energy. But somehow they have the energy to repeatedly blow up at me for being behind them in the room, week after week, month after month... It just doesn't make sense. 

I am now engaging with therapy again, as this relapse has caused me to feel darker and lower than ever. Being told repeatedly that I am a bad, inconsiderate person who is at the root of all their pain and problems has worn me down to the point of feeling completely lost in life. 

My current therapist is smart, precise and very knowledgeable. While he cannot diagnose anyone he doesn't know, he has opened my eyes to the fact that my partner's problems are not my fault, nor are they caused by me. No amount of walking on egg shells will make them happy - for every problem I try to solve, they will think of another. Most importantly, I have learned that I am not triggering my partner's illness - when they become dysregulated, which will happen regardless what I do or say, they are merely reaching for someone or something to pin their feelings of anger, fear, hurt and frustration to. I am simply the closest person, and thus the easiest to frame and blame. 

Talking to their family, I have learned that some of their problems go back to childhood, and I am now wondering if these two breakdowns I have witnessed were in fact not sudden occurrences due to specific events, but just a few in a life-long line of similar events. 

I still love them deeply - I have to believe that the person I got to know is still in there. They sometimes resurface, and I should be grateful and enjoy these times, but this has become difficult, knowing it will just be a matter of time before they crash again, and I am back to being persona non grata in my own home. 

I was previously encouraged to wait for the good periods to bring up to them how hard I was struggling with the constant ups and downs, but this has been a bad move - it seems to set off downturns, as they appear so in denial that any mention of the dark times shake their entire sense of self. I don't yet know if they are in denial about the realities of those times, or if they genuinely do suffer some memory loss. Either way I feel gaslit - it's like I'm living in the upside down, experiencing all this pain because of how I'm treated, only to be told that I am the one inflicting pain on them, by my sheer existence. 

I feel lost - I don't want to leave - but I can't continue to live like this."
MentalHealthUK,09/17/21 16:00:54,"I really don't know what to do. I feel like everything has fallen apart and I'm broken, and I wish I could just have a hug.","This is I guess partly a vent and partly an ""I need support"" post. I'm really sorry for making you all deal with me anyway.

The last several days (really the last two weeks, but particularly the last five or so days) have just been unimaginably difficult. I've been stuck in constant thought-loops, nearly 24/7, about how much I hate myself and how disgusting I am. I'm on the edge of breaking down crying nearly all the time. I've barely been lucid to be honest with you.

 I've dealt with pretty bad depression before, but nothing like this -- I had no idea it was possible to feel like this. I can barely sleep, I wake up and instantly, relentlessly, my mind starts bludgeoning me about how much I hate myself, how much I deserve to feel like this, how pathetic and broken I am as a human being, how if I were anything like a real man, I'd just man-the-fuck-up and get over it. How I will never be, and don't deserve to be, loved. It's all-consuming, it's eaten away at me until there's nothing left but a fire-filled void where my humanity should be that alternately burns and sears until I'm begging it to stop, at which point it goes away only to be replaced by such a fucking dehumanising, agonising *emptiness* that I the only thing I can do is crawl up into a ball and sob.

 I'm not even remotely a religious person, but I feel like prostrating myself and begging to any and every god, divinity, entity or higher being ever conceived to just fucking give me some respite, to give me my soul back from the thing that's stolen it away from me. 

I've only been up for an hour and a half and I've already broken down crying three fucking times, and am currently doing so a fourth time as I'm writing this. I just don't know what to do, I'm genuinely not sure if I'm going to be here in a week's time (I certainly don't feel like I want to) and I feel like everything has fallen apart, and then those broken parts have themselves fallen apart. I feel like my soul has been put through a shredder then burnt to ash. I've never felt anything like this and at this point I just want it to stop -- it's beyond torture. I posted [this] (https://old.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/pp9lyt/why_i_hate_myself_and_why_i_deserve_to_feel_this/)  on an alt-account yesterday, some of you may have seen it (sorry if you did; it's pretty OTT). It's basically a self-hate letter I wrote to myself which explains some of what I'm feeling I suppose.

I wish I could just have a hug but, unfortunately, there's no one around to give me one. I don't know what to do and I'm asking for help because I'm at rock-bottom and I feel so trapped and alone.

To anyone who reads this -- please know that I'm sending you my genuinely and heartfelt love and thoughts for whatever has brought you to this subreddit. Don't know if that means anything to any of you, but I truly mean it.

Sorry if this violates the spamming rule, having made a post yesterday on another account. And sorry for the flowery, over-dramatic language as well -- it's kinda how I express these things."
MentalHealthUK,09/17/21 10:19:38,I developed a mental health related app from my personal experience!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

I was never told the stuff I told her would be put on my record etc. I've been left in the dark about lots of things.

Can someone please help and let me know if I'd be entitled to this information. If I am, how can I go about getting the information and find out exactly what the manager told other services about me, and which services the manager told? Thanks, I appreciate any advice."

MentalHealthUK,09/17/21 03:33:41,Finding the calm of the storm,"Just wanted to contribute something on here that I thought about today that has somehow helped me: 

You need to fight yourself bang in the middle of the tornado in order to find the calm of the storm. 


You either get whirled around like a washing machine, you power the machine or coexist WITH it. 

In the middle of the tornado is the reason for your issues laying there as clear as day. You may have many tornados causing mountains of chaos. 

That thing in isolation is calm, peaceful and existing, causing chaos unbeknownst to itself. 

Find it. Control it. Master it. 

Find your inner tornado. 

It means battling yourself in from the outside, going through life changing amounts of pain and suffering and persistence. Lots and lots of work and perseverance. 

You won't be the same person on the inside of it as you were on the outside. You would've learned things about yourself and the world that you could never imagine.

Make the suffering you're going through try and mean something. 

I believe in you. Whoever you are, whatever your story is. 

Go get 'em."
MentalHealthUK,09/16/21 22:58:14,Doing CBT,"Today has been the weirdest day for me. 

When I first went to my GP about my depression I was told to do Talking Therapies to which he referred me on to. This therapist I was assigned to put me on CBT and for me …. It really didn’t work, I came out feeling the same way I felt going in. 

But today, I don’t know if it’s the medication because I’m on a different dosage ….  but I did a course with my work …. Learning about CBT and DBT …. 

I work for individuals with learning disabilities, so the CBT was simplified down so much so not only do we use it on them … but we use it on ourselves …. I got more out of that 1 course then I did actually going to a therapist with 6 sessions … 

I definitely feel lighter and happier, it’s not to say I definitely know how to keep applying it on to my life but I know it’s a step in where it can become a skill I learn myself. But whilst saying that I still don’t really know where to start with myself. 

I know people say start small like have a shower … tidy your room… and gradually build yourself into a space that you can keep handling but even the thought of some things just overwhelm me. 

It’s so weird because I really am starting to see the toll Depression has had on me…. I was such a confident, head strong individual when I was younger… I would just crack on and do things and would task myself to do bits …. But now, the littlest of things spiral me back into a deep depression or back into my ED

What was one of the first steps for all of you, if you’ve made one ? …. I’m in a good space right now and whilst i am I want to build the motivation so I don’t fall. 

Any tips ?"
MentalHealthUK,09/16/21 22:46:54,Worried about a stranger (asking for help),"Hey,

I'm worried about an owner of a shop I visited a couple of times. A week or two ago at around 11pm, I was going past his shop when I saw the light on (which is unusual since it's so late) and the door open, as I walked past it he was sitting on a chair he put in front of his door and was staring at a wall that is 5cm away from him, he was covered in unusual clothing and I think some sort of music was playing but I don't remember. I thought that was weird but I ignored it. Today at 10 pm I was going past his shop again, this time it was closed and dark however when I looked at it while going past I saw a ton of clothing around the shop, boxes and in front of the door was a ton of opened out of the box food (pizza slices, chips, etc... In addition, my mum has seen him on a bike talking to himself loudly and today while walking home I saw him crouched in the middle of the placement with a finger inside a hole made in the pavement muttering random words.

I remember when I visited him in his shop he was very chill, the shop is a phone repair shop and the owner was always good to me and he seemed sane, however, this is very unusual and I do not think he is in the right state of mind.

I'm writing this here because I do not know what to do. Do I call 111? The police? The council? I'm not sure what to do and I don't wanna leave him in a state like that."
MentalHealthUK,09/16/21 18:38:53,Had a lightbulb moment about the crisis team during my therapy today and read my risk summary,"Just left my therapy session, side note therapy is going so well, I'm doing trauma focused CBT with the NHS and it's been so useful for me and I feel like I get on well with my therapist :)

**Another sidenote: if you think you're my therapist after you read this post please pretend you never saw my reddit account. This never happened okay.**  
In todays session I had one of those lightbulb moments and I realised that often when I call the crisis number I feel underestimated and even challenged to act on my thoughts. From discussing I think it's because they haven't taken the time to validate my feelings and understand how/why I'm in so much distress instead they've rushed into what things I should be doing or should have already done to combat my feelings. Like thanks for telling me I should have met up with friends yesterday, that's so helpful for me rn.

My therapist suggested we look at my risk summary (which I guess is similar to a crisis plan but it's what the crisis team read when I call up) and that we adjust it so that they can know how to better help me, and not unintentionally cause me to harm myself. And I think we did a good job.  
However the first line I read will stick with me. ""What can I do to manage on a day-to-day basis?""  
\[**TW\] self harm (if you want, skip to the last paragraph or stop reading here)**  
It was along the lines of &gt;!""do superficial cuts that need minimal medical care""!&lt;  
I don't know who put that in my summary or why. Last time I did that was in January but my view of self harm is I have always wanted to just stop, cold turkey. I've never thought ""i'll just self harm less dangerously"", my more serious self harm was always accidental. I don't really know how to clearly explain but basically for me that would not be helpful (it might be helpful for others but not me) and I have never expressed what they wrote in my notes. My therapist also didn't seem comfortable with that note and we decided to remove it immediately.  


Overall it was really interesting seeing what mental health workers had written about me. I can understand why, once when I called, I was told I should have hung out with friends the day before, because all they had to go off for one bracket was ""meeting friends...structure...walking"". Plus, I'm really glad I got to work with my therapist to make it more accurate and hopefully more helpful, both for me and for whoever talks to me in the future. I think this will have a positive impact. (Lastly, shout out to virtual therapy and screen sharing lol)"

Why I hate myself, and why I deserve to feel this way.Vent (self.MentalHealthUK)

submitted 2 hours ago by baby_yoda357

I hate and despise myself more than anyone could ever understand. There's nothing good or likeable about me, I'm a total failure as a human and a pathetic excuse for a man and I don't want to deal with it anymore, and no one else should have to either. I'm the complete and utter opposite of what a man should be and no woman will EVER love or want me because I'm a pathetic, disgusting, unmasculine, testosteroneless, beta male little ****** piece of shit, I have NONE of the qualities women look for in a partner, none of the strong, extroverted, exciting, stoic, assertive masculine energy that would make someone attracted to or want to be with me. Women do not want men like me. Society does not want or need men like me. I am below human.

These things are undeniably true. Any woman who meets me would be, and is, so disgusted with me because of how ugly I am and how my personality is the opposite of everything a man is meant to be, their fucking ovaries cringe in disgust. If they saw me on a dating app they'd practically dislocate your thumb swiping left so hard. Any friend of mine would never consider, for example, trying to set me and a friend of theirs up because they know how fucking pathetic and disgraceful I am as a man, how unworthy and undeserving I am of love, attention, affection and attraction.

I'm a non-human and have less worth and value as a man than a slug and I've accepted that I am not, and will never be, important or attractive to anyone. I'm EXTREMELY ugly physically, my face is fucking repulsive and I have the body of a ****** with my fucked up teeth, fucked up back, small effeminate wrists, etc, etc.

If these things weren't true, I wouldn't be a 24 year old male whose never been in a relationship, never been on a date, never had sex or even kissed someone, I wouldn't have 0 matches on any dating apps. Do you understand how abnormal, how pathetic and disgraceful and embarrassing and repulsive that is for a man of my age? Normal, real men have done all these things. The proof is in the pudding, I'm self-evidently vile to women and extremely off-putting to people in general. The above facts are their own proofs, their own truths -- incontrovertible, irrefutable, undeniable, unequivocable.

It's genuinely no wonder I was abused growing up, I deserve everything I've gotten and everything I currently feel. I'm pathetic and disgusting and I have absolute immutable certainty that I will be alone forever, that there is no point in me trying to get better because I will still fundamentally be the person I am, the things outlined above, and I have absolutely no desire to be trapped in this fucking deficient shell of a soul any longer, nor force anyone else to have to be trapped by dealing with me. My personality and the way I look completely preclude me from ever experiencing the love and intimacy with another human that we naturally desire and having that knowledge is soul-destroyingly unbearable and makes me quite literally shake with hatred for myself, for being the thing that I am. I am not a real human."

MentalHealthUK,09/16/21 04:14:24,How can I get NHS prescription for my anti-depressive drug?,"Hi there!

I recently moved to the UK and it seems like I don't understand how NHS works.

**TL;DR;** I'm taking bupropion for a year. In the country I'm from this is a licensed anti-depressive drug. In the UK it's licensed for smoking cessation only. I want to get an NHS prescription for this drug. Is there a way to do so?

The longer version of the story:

I have PTSD and taking SSRI (sertraline) against anxiety and NDRI (bupropion) to fight hypersomnia and fatigue. When I arrived in the UK it was lockdown. I used the Babilon app and asked their GP for prescribing me sertraline and bupropion. He gave me a prescription for sertraline without any problems. About bupropion, he said that he needed confirmation from the licensed psychiatrist to do so. He made a referral letter and suggested using my insurance to speed up the process.

I made an appointment and I visited a psychiatrist. She confirmed that I need bupropion. She gave me a private prescription ""in case of any"" and sent a letter to Babilon GP where described the motivation for prescribing me it.

I got an appointment with Babilon GP. This time it was another GP. This person was much less friendly and told me that she can't make a prescription because this is an off-label way of using bupropion. I asked for an alternative drug, she said that the formula is unique. If I want I can receive a private prescription and pay full price for bupropion but there is no way to get an NHS prescription. Needless to say that bupropion is a pricy med.

I asked her whether she can prescribe me it after the assessment at at NHS psychiatrist or not? She answered that the NHS psychiatrist will never prescribe me this drug for hypersomnia or depression.

So, could anybody advise on that? I really need this meds, without them I'm sleepy all the time. Is it true that NHS GP can't give me a prescription for off-label treatment or there are some protocols to do so?"
MentalHealthUK,09/16/21 00:56:37,How to become a Therapist or something related without A-Levels in the UK?,"So a little backstory first, I’ve been in addiction since the age of 15 all the way up until 4 months ago, when I finally got the willpower and said I quit this sh*t. I am 21, turning 22 in December and I am attending a charity based college which only teaches single 2 hour courses on everything around Mental Health &amp; Addiction, like how to live, manage, and help others get through what I’ve been through myself all while maintaining and constantly working on my recovery, as I’ve been taught that “‘Recovery’ is a journey with no end”.

I didn’t manage to finish my A-Levels due to addiction and mental health problems, I’ve only got 10 GCSE’s, (1 A*, 4 A’s, 1 B, 4 C’s and 1 D, but I was told by teachers that anything below C isn’t good enough to count it as 1 GCSE grade, not sure if that’s true however) not including the D I got in computer science.

Where do I start? Or what would be the best place to start once I finish all the charity college courses and get a certificate from the college but I’m guessing it’s not very official since it’s charity based, however I am not doing the courses to gain work experience or a degree, I’m doing them so that I can attend a real college or maybe a university (as my mental health currently is so poor I can’t even work part time as a waiter in a restaurant) and I’m only 22, ive got plenty of time to do any necessary courses which will allow me to get accepted to a proper college/uni and get a REAL degree in psychology or anything related to Mental Health.

I’m open to all suggestions and I’m asking in advance so that I can get right into further education by the start of 2022 without “having a break” or staying idle, because although I’ve got plenty of time it doesn’t mean I want to waste it doing nothing.

Also if anybody has a degree or is in a Mental Health related profession please could you contact me privately as I am looking for a mentor/guide to help walk me through the steps (not do work for me, only telling me what work needs to be done, where it needs to be done and by when)

I again am open to all suggestions from starting from Level 1-2 courses/apprenticeships and slowly working my way up as far as possible (yes, I would consider working my way all the way up to a PhD degree of some sort) no matter how long it takes, I don’t care if it will take 5,6,7 or 10 years I want a degree.

Many thanks and looking forward to hearing from you guys."

I have progressively gotten worse. 3 suicide attempts ending in hospital and now alcohol problems.  My alcohol abuse has lead to blackouts, self harm, tantrums where I scream and bang my head and body against walls for years.
I'm not in hospital for an attempt.  I had took 50 and know did I fell asleep woke up three up for hours and went to a&amp;e from there
Today before my attempt I was distressed severely.  I broke my chair and smashed a glass bottle containing coconut oil . Proceeded to self harm and overdose. 
In the days leading up to my overdose I had extreme anxiety and intrusive thoughts and was obsessing. I would wake up at night with a lot of anxiety because of this and this lead to my mental health getting worse. I was obsessing over something someone said to me who supports me in the hostel and it was constantly on my mind . 
I had thoughts of suicide come and go but it just built up worse for me. I constantly get vivid images in my head of suicide methods and me killing myself . 
Tge alcohol doesn't help too after my relapse all I wanted to do was drink. I feel like if I was able to drink I would've felt better. But I have no money left cause I spent it all on alcohol and takeaway  because I wanted to feel better. 
I want help and I need help because I'm scared if I don't get help I will get worse and continue to drink and have these outbursts and end up in jail. 
I have a lot of trauma in my life to with my family and also abuse in my life with neglect
What should I do I don't know each time I leave its worse I'm thinking of possiblyeven impatient help I feel stuck. 
I feel don't understand in a&amp;e they asked if I really took that amount and I did I just was throwing up so long before they were called. I felt judged and like I was being called a liar.

This is great news but the only downside is I'll have to wait at least 6 months taking me to Feb/March next year.

I know these sorts of waits aren't uncommon so I'm just wondering what things I could look into doing until CBT starts? I'm prescribed Pregabalin for my anxiety (currently at 50mg) and I'm going to see if I can have a meds review to see if it can be increased as it doesn't seem to be touching my anxiety.

I'm going to try &amp; keep my mind/body active as well by gently encouraging myself to exercise more &amp; take some classes to get my qualifications up to speed.

Is there anything I could look into doing? Are there any CBT workbooks/self-help guides I could look into until the sessions start?

MentalHealthUK,09/13/21 12:20:21,I am so scared of the future,"My parents are elderly. I have nobody in life. Despite having a good degree, I can get nowhere in the employment market despite years of trying. 

I am fucking terrified. I don't want to be that old autistic man with no hope, sitting at home in misery for the rest of my days.

This world is harsh. Fuck, I am suffering."
MentalHealthUK,09/13/21 04:41:45,Where do I go next?,"I'm better than I was in January, but my anxiety can still be crippling, like waking up mid panic attack, googling ""how to run away"", intrusive thoughts that I've done awful things at work.

I've had a year of private counselling (low cost but I can't even afford that anymore), CMHT input for meds (quite a traumatic and unhelpful experience) and my GP, and all the things they tell you to do (exercise, mindfulness etc)

But I have no idea where to go next, or what to do.

Should I just hope an increase of medication helps?
I'll literally try anything to be able to cope with my own emotions."
MentalHealthUK,09/12/21 21:05:38,So I’m hallucinating and I don’t know what to do,"For a long time I’ve had weird feelings of paranoia and unease and every once in a while I see something that doesn’t make sense.  The first one I can recall was when I was 7 and I saw a rotting hand emerge from behind the back of a small building at my school, grip the wall and then slide back round.  Ever since then I’ve noticed weird things but my parents have often commented on how I would stare at things as if there was someone there.  I spoke to myself as a child and would often say odd things, some I remember and some I don’t.

Last year things really ramped up.  I heard voices in the walls of my flat, all around me and on multiple nights.  I asked my neighbours every time and they insisted they weren’t responsible.

A few times I’ve noticed things out of the corner of my eye.  But sometimes they’re worse, much worse.  A few months ago I was sitting at my desk and felt something next to me, I looked over and saw a massive man made entirely of black shadows standing there, I ran out my room and looked back and they were gone.

This morning I felt something behind me so I turned around in my kitchen and saw something move.  It was big, like a dog size.  I only saw a blur but it was there.

Is this something I need to be worried about or is my mind just playing tricks on me?"
MentalHealthUK,09/12/21 20:45:44,What happens after your assessment with an Access/Affective Team and they think you've got complex trauma?,"I'm curious if any of you have experience in this. What happens afterwards, say if you have an assessment with a mental health nurse or something there and they believe you have complex trauma and it affects your life badly? Say if they direct you to the Affective Team that's there (I believe) to help people with long-term issues."
MentalHealthUK,09/12/21 18:03:20,I'm sick of the bullying culture in the retail industry in the UK.,"I have been bullied 4 times each lasting a period of years in my 17 years of the retail industry, and despite numerous complaints to management nothing satisfactory was ever done.

Two bullying events were committed by the same supervisor and each time when the complaints from staff, (myself included) resulted in the issue being buried by management and the person in question was transferred to a new store only to return after a few years. 

The second time this person was given a promotion when they did it. A manager whom I got along with confirmed that the promotion was given was for two reasons:

The first was to make the transfer quicker and make the bully more likely to accept it without further drama.

The second is that the retail industry enjoys bullying superiors for their short term effect of increasing worker output through fear. Bottom level staff usually burn out and leave rather than complain, and there are plenty more people where that came from.

This person has returned again recently, and now I have to work alongside them, a person who was promoted for their behaviour whilst I was left with a severe anxiety disorder.

I can't leave my job, employment where I life is scarce, nor do I believe I should have to leave. My only solace is that now I am a contractor so they can only interact with me so much.

I witnessed many colleagues quit their job because of these events, some with health issues as a result.

The cherry on the cake is that the retail company now has posters everywhere for mental health promotion and reporting bullying, and yet still nothing is ever done.

Im probably just screaming into the void, but I guess I needed to. Working with this person again has me on edge.

Just so tired of seeing the same cycles repeat over and over even when to the public eye everying is peachy.

I'll probably remove this post after a while as I'm a bit shy online. Just felt I had to say something."
MentalHealthUK,09/11/21 15:34:10,Am I emotionally numb?," 

Months ago, my best friend was diagnosed with a serious health condition. We were best friends for almost 10 years at school. Surprisingly, When I received the news, I didn't feel sad at all. It made me feel guilty and made me feel like a bad friend. I thought that I was emotionally numb and I had no emotions.

Few weeks ago, I watched a movie in which a character dies. While watching that scene, I felt pretty sad and almost cried. Then I realized that I was emotional for a character who was introduced an hour ago but not my best friend whom I knew for 10 years. It is frustrating and is making me feel guilty everyday.

Please help me realize what is wrong with me."
MentalHealthUK,09/11/21 15:30:30,"Depression relapse after months of being fine, not even sure if this is depression now, is it some biochemical issue?","Hey, I'm nearly 40, been suffering with depression and anxiety for a few years. Initially on citilopram, worked at first then pooped out - became totally numb and gained a ton of weight. Went on to amitriptyline, worked better but still gained weight and lost libido, gave up in the end.

I've been feeling great for 6 months and now relapsed.

My main symptoms are:

Hot head
Tight feeling around my head
Brain fog 
Irritability
Feeling low and withdrawn
Fatigue
No interest in anything

I have a good family life and a good (albeit stressful) job. I don't feel as if there is anything in particular bothering me, it really feels like an illness or something which makes me wonder if it's an imbalance of something. 

My symptoms tend to come roughly once a month, weirdly, nearly always when my wife has her period....I can't find any concrete info on this phenomena online. 

I really don't want to go back on meds. I'd previously tried st Johns wort, ashwaganda, 5htp, turmeric, diet changes, meditation, exercise, none of them made any difference.

I'm rambling now but I guess I'm confused as to whether this 'once a month' thing is depression or something else. Any thoughts?

Thanks for reading."
MentalHealthUK,09/11/21 06:16:30,CBD for anxiety: What the research says (Science Based),"I everyone, human biology graduate here. I recently wrote an article on CBD for anxiety. In summary, several human randomised controlled trials have suggested that CBD may be effective in treating anxiety (the bulk of evidence is in relation to social anxiety disorder).

[https://simplycannaco.com/cbd-for-anxiety/](https://simplycannaco.com/cbd-for-anxiety/)

DISCLAIMER:

Seeing a psychiatrist is the best thing that you can do to help get to the root cause of an anxiety disorder. Examples of treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioural therapy, exposure therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy.

⁠Whilst something might alleviate the symptoms this doesn’t necessarily tackle the root cause. For example, exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety but that may not fix the root cause of the anxiety disorder.

⁠If you suspect that you have an anxiety disorder please see a doctor or a psychologist before looking for products to reduce anxiety."
MentalHealthUK,09/11/21 03:48:33,I’m really struggling right now.,"My OCD is so bad right now. I'm in a deep depression, and I have no support. To make it worse, I'm a caregiver, and I'm struggling to provide the care that's needed because of my mental health. My mental health has gotten so bad, I feel like taking my own life."
MentalHealthUK,09/11/21 01:00:24,Just a vent...,"So I've got mental health stuff.  Diagnosed (early 20's) as general anxiety and depression but (I'm 40) despite the decades of me saying there's something else etc, I just get given whatever med I've not tried to date and get told to use my senses to snap me out of whatever mood I'm currently in.  I'm sure for some people that's enough but I have no dependants, single, middle aged male...there's no resources out there for me beyond pop a pill and cross your fingers.  


Couple of days ago I walked out my job.  Had to report a male staff member a few months ago for touching up females, one in particular was being affected real bad by it.  Anyway, all his pals in there have decided I'm a liar and I'm getting harrassed at work now, or as I'm told, bullied.  I've spoken to supervisors, all managers, HR and despite their promises of we will protect you etc etc I've just been left and ignored.  Constant complaints about how staff have been treating me the past wee while.  Kinda lost my temper with the top manager and told him the place has let me down, showcased willfull complacency, my mental health has been destroyed due to everything and now I'm just so lost.  Might have told him I was gonna sue the bit aswell lol.

Literally no one has been in touch to see if I've been ok.  Got a voicemail from a manager saying she wanted to 'catch up'.  I've no one to talk to about this.  This current episode of mental health has me defeated, completely and it's really scary in my head just now.  I have a plan.  I just don't know what to do.  Last time I got help with my mental health (early this year) I was told I should open up more and express myself.  I've been telling everyone that will listen 'It's coming back'  'I'm doing really badly' 'My mental health has taken a real turn for the worse'..... but it's just the same as saying nothing at all.

I get told I'm very funny, I'm a really good friend, really fun to be around and I'm willing to help anybody with anything.  But it's just all a front.  I'm sure you know how exhausting that can be daily, but freeing for those few hours also while putting up a front.

I wasn't going to go further but it's my post and you don't have to read it.  It's like people get to know me and decide they don't like what they see.  Family always told me I was making up my mental health stuff, don't really speak to them.  Few friends, not even loyal ones or that really care.  After my last struggle one of them told me they would miss me if I did something silly.  I suppose that's about the extent of what I expected.

I don't know.  It's just really hard to convey just how much this daily anguish is taking it's toll.  I can't face another decade of it, I just can't.  I'm exhausted.  Exhausted and I'm sick of this 'pain'.

I just don't know what to do.  You might advise telling professionals all this, I have.  They told me I'm that type of person who 'just has depression' and if I feel down touch something or listen for birds singing etc etc.  I'm sick of listening to myself about my mental health.  If it comes up I talk openly about it, I don't shy away from it.  I'm a very open person with regards to that.  Expressing myself doesn't make it go away though.  It's always still there isn't it.  I can laugh, but I'm always sad.  I cry to release whatever is built up inside but it just makes me feel so heavy I can't move.  I don't know what to do, I'm just at a loss and I really feel that I've travelled a path that has come to an end.

If you read it all thanks, I've done a really bad job expressing how much pain I'm in.  I'm not looking for sympathy I just want to be heard."
MentalHealthUK,09/11/21 00:45:23,I wrote a poem about how I feel currently,"Happy, by me (2021)

I don't know how to be happy any more,
I'm sure I knew how to do it before.
But something is absent, missing, gone.
And now it's all flat, and empty and wrong.

I used to be happy, a smile on my face,
A laugh and a joke, whatever time and place.
Now my brain is a fog, a TV out of tune,
A black murky shadow has filled the room.

My body is telling me ""sleep"" all the time,
Maybe then you'll wake up and all will be fine.
But when my eyes open the ""nothing"" is still there,
The blanket that's dousing my ability to care.

The world that I once saw in full technicolour,
A 4k experience full of joy and wonder, 
Has turned monochrome and lost its appeal.
A flat background for which I find nothing to feel.

I used to feel happy, but not any more
Everything feels like a bore or a chore.
It's like I'm lost in the fog and I can find my way.
I'm fumbling blindly day after day.

I want to feel happy, but can't seem to find
The set of instructions that I left behind.
If anyone finds them while out and about
I'd appreciate it if you gave me a shout."

I planned to try and go out tonight and now I'm just a crying mess and refrained from ODing as soon as she left. I'm honestly just so, so tired. Its just keeping distracted, keeping more distracted etc...

I'm not sure what I'm expecting, but surely there's more...my suicide plan gave me peace at the weekend, but not going through with it made the world crash down for a few days and there's an inkling of resentment for my dog because he is the reason I didn't go through, and I obviously feel terrible for it, and can't help but feel they expect the dog to protect me from myself forever.

I've hit my head, relapsed on self harm and just generally had a very hard time coping with my emotions this week. I have been a little better this past day but....this is just a day in a week. Drinking or smoking are my options to get through tonight. But there's nothing more then can offer me...just encouragement to distract."

MentalHealthUK,09/10/21 15:17:59,How do you get over that feeling of powerlessness and the dissociation/emotional flashback that comes with it?,"It feels like my head is stuck spinning and my mind can't move because of being made to feel powerless by someone who was supposed to help.

This person is part of a mental health organisation has also emotionally manipulated me, gaslighted me, gave me the silent treatment after saying they cared, made false promises, asked leading/suggestive questions, lied about things I said when they wrote an assessment of me and did that DARVO thing where they reversed it and made themselves and the organisation out to be the victim.

The mental health organisation and people in it have treated me like dirt and been so condescending. I've been questioning my sanity so much because of this, it's hell. I'm powerless to do anything because they said any more contact I make asking for answers as to how they could treat me like this will not be reported. I'm now made to feel like I'm the bad one.

What's happened has put me into a emotional flashback, made me doubt my sanity, make me feel like the powerless frightened abused child again,made me feel like my head is just stuck unable to do anything, made my tinnitus worse and put loads of tension in my head. It's hell.

Can any of you relate to the feelings of powerlessness and it triggering your ptsd?

The best way to describe it is almost like i don't understand how the world works or why i was doing a task even though i knew what i was doing and what that task was. I get behind the wheel of my car and get confused by how fast i should be going or what the speed limit is how junctions work yet i seem to get from A to B fine and safe. At the moment the worst thing I'm struggling with is unwritten rules or concepts like paying for something rather than just walking out with it even though i know i need to pay or what i own and what i don't own. Or what i can can't or should say to someone. Very worried I'm going to step out infront of a car or something. Its almost like a mental block or my thoughts are very strange ill think about pointless details when im in a building like who owns it who built it how it all works. I'm struggling to comprehended the world around me. I've had an MRI,bloods taken etc all clear and doctor have prescribed 50mg of steraline yesterday. Not sure whats wrong with me sorry for my grammar I'm new to this. I definitely have some dp/dr but never had anything like this before. No I'm not hearing voices or seeing anything.

Private Psychiatrist.  Agreed.  Diagnosed Bipolar and onto meds.  This is 5 years now.  In that 5 years one section for 2 months.   I demanded back to private Dr Lithium started etc.    MASSIVE difference,

MentalHealthUK,09/08/21 00:24:05,Reasonable Adjustments for GAD (Among other things),"I just recently had an interview with a company for a job that I was well suited for and I believe (based on the comments in the after interview feedback) was one of the top two candidates for the post. Ultimately though I was passed over for the other candidate based on the fact that I was noticeably anxious on the day and stuttered a bit and I am guessing they were not.

I specifically mentioned in the call where they informed me of the outcome that I had severe generalised anxiety disorder and that I was dissappointed because I couldnt do anything about it so pressed for other reasons. When pressed for other reasons I could actually do something about they just repeated the overwritten

I spoke with MIND charities info line who advised I speak with their legal team for clarity and they said this would only apply if the employer knew which I didnt initially think they did from my application. While I did in fact put  that I consider my mental health to be a disability the only thing I can think of is this in of itself wasnt enough to prompt consideration .

Contrary to all things I have mentioned to this point I want to be clear I dont want to look at this from a discrimination standpoint, as despite specifying the loose nature of the condition I think it might be my fault for not providing any potential reasonable adjustments as I just didnt know what I could ask for.

So my only question really, is under the equalities act, what level of consideration can I actually hope for GAD to get.

**Can interviewers be informed ahead of time that I have anxiety and may be anxious in interview, is that legal or does that effectively impart bias which could be deemed illegal?**

**Or do I need to ask for another reasonable adjustment that mitigates my anxiety rather than informing them to be mindful of it?**"
MentalHealthUK,09/07/21 23:02:28,Community mental health team - advice? (tw?),"I've been with this service for 4 years, with a brief gap when I was briefly discharged. The thing is, during my time with them (18-22, current) things have only gotten worse, and I feel they've been fairly unhelp in general.

All I've ever done with them is countless workbooks, mindfulness etc. I did get referred to MBT spring this year, but was turned down due to instability and anxiety. I then got referred to OT but I did not see this helping after the assessment, and really feel there are many others who would benefit more than me from this. I then asked about other therapy, like CBT, but that was ignored and not even spoken about. I don't understand why? As so often we are reminded that medication alone will not entirely help us.

Even medication, I have tried 5 varies types and non have helped, or they had bad side effects. Yet since my re-referral this is what they have been pushing the most and at first (before I put my foot down and said no at the pharmacist appointment) they put it in a way that I would be able to discuss some PRN medications rather than daily meds, which was not the case. 

I also fear even asking for meds for I had 10 infections in one tooth last year before it was removed (all within a few months) and was prescribed tramadol. I had a 111 nurse accuse me of drug seeking when they ran out and I was unable to function due to the pain in my tooth. So then it went down on my records as ""drug seeking"" and I had to go through a much lengthier process to get the pain relief I needed. She straight up lied and said that I said I couldn't function without the meds. There's actually an alarming number of mistakes and wrong info on the records that I can access.

But it seems they would rather me smoke weed in low-mood/crisis, and this feels very backwards. I was basically told its okay if it helps, despite me saying I want to quit, I'm worried about my current increase, and giving valid reasons for wanting to quit. Especially considering: I've already stopped drinking, as I used to binge badly; I do use other drugs such as ket and coke, recreationally most of the time but sometimes I badly want to on a casual morning; And last year I was smoking 3-4g of weed a day, which I cut down massively from, and wanted to quit but was never able to. I am now back in this position, however now I've blown through all my savings and I don't want to go back to scavenging for money, and I'm worried about loosing my flat, or having to quit cold turkey.

Some pretty hurtful comments have been made along the way too by various 4 CPNS. Such as being too young to see a Dr despite multiple suicide attempts, being told I've been with the service too long. I'm now fairly angry that I was told my weed smoking was okay.

I am now hitting more points of crisis due to the financial issues caused. I am struggling to stay in control, I have self harmed and hit my head multiple times in the last few days, screamed and cried and I feel utterly pathetic. I am trapped, and suicide feels like a sensible option. There is too much going on and not anything at the same time. I really don't know what to do or how to get SOMEONE to listen to me and help me. I am trying so so hard, but I can't keep doing this, or getting false hope."
MentalHealthUK,09/07/21 21:58:30,Advice: How can I overcome memories from my childhood that are now plaging my dreams.,"Hi, I'm 33. I went through a lot of shit as a child, sexual abuse  neglect, emotional from both parents but I also had years of therapy as a teen and upon leaving my family home at 16, I've been able to move on. 

However the last week I've been having vivid horrible dreams  of events/ circumstances that happened when I was younger  (I'd say 5 nights out of 7) and they're quite traumatic in themselves but when I wake it just makes me incredibly sad because it brings everything back. 

The only major thing is my mum going into hospital a few weeks ago and almost dying. Ever since I've been calling her nearly daily to check that she's looking after herself.

 Could this be whats causing the memories? I feel bad cutting contact if she's not looking after herself but I suppose she does have other people around her."
MentalHealthUK,09/07/21 21:34:38,Anyone else feeling hopeless about the state of GPs?,"Was told by reception that the doctors would call me on Monday to follow up on how my anti-depressants are going. Had my phone with me all day, never heard anything from them and got blown off.

I'm trying to be patient and understanding, I know covid and tories cutting away at the NHS budget has made things harder for them but god damn is it too much to ask to be given a little empathy in return? 
How long does it take to send a text telling me the appointment is cancelled or postponed but they couldn't even do that.

It worries me that if my mental health gets worse there might be nowhere for me to go, no one to turn to for professional help when I really need it.

MentalHealthUK,09/07/21 00:39:29,What do I do when college causes me extreme anxiety and unhappiness,"I've only realised recently that this is an actual problem and that school has severely damaged my mental health, but now I've still got one more year to get through and it's not even online like with covid so it just seems too much.

My time in class consists of me learning nearly absolutely nothing because I can't focus and the actual teachers are stuck revising things that we already know, trying not to burst out in tears, wanting to go home, feeling extremely lonely because I have trouble getting friends and doodling. 

Every single staff member belittles me, and I can't quit/switch colleges because of financial reasons. 

I'm going to get a counselling assessment next week and hopefully some actual help, but for now I'm feeling helpless. My family is of basically no help too.

Thank you for any advice"
MentalHealthUK,09/06/21 22:32:58,I need a friendly hug (and not a creepy one),"I was told I would be discharged from the psych ward at the end of last week or the start of this week.   I still haven’t been discharged.   My mood is more stable, I feel more calm and able to get back to my life, but I am still here and I am worried that if I am here much longer my mental health will get worse.   Some of my friends here have been discharged, and my friend from the room next door has been randomly moved to another corridor.  


I am feeling lonely and isolated in my room because some people here have started to make me feel uncomfortable.


Over the weekend, I have been hit on by a creepy dude, making unwanted sexual comments to me.   Unfortunately he has since been moved into a room very close to mine, so I am having to keep my door shut when I am in my room.   When I’ve been in communal areas, a big dude has been invading my personal space, touching me and trying to hug me, so I feel uncomfortable in the communal areas now.   Hence being isolated in my room.   I want to go home - and a week ago I was told I would be going home about now.  

I want my husband, kids, friends or dog to hug me.   Nice hugs.   Not creepy ones."
MentalHealthUK,09/06/21 19:27:23,Resource for under 25s,"There is a website called Kooth: 
https://www.kooth.com

That 16- 25 year olds can use I believe. You create a anonymous account where you can speak to a fully qualified counsellor once a week, and they can offer to set up long term support for you. 

If you're struggling and can't access services, this could be a good alternative for you - or at least something to keep you going until you can access them. 

There are also thinks like online diaries, mood monitors etc. for those that may benefit from that too."
MentalHealthUK,09/06/21 01:11:45,I need some advice on how to deal with this issue,"I've been noticing many things over the last ten years. People keep excluding me from things. I used to be in the ATC when i was younger. I was always picked last for everything. Over 40 people went and i was always picked last. I don't get on with my Dad, I have argued with him for years. I have always felt that he was very cold towards me.

People keep looking at me in the street. I see them watch me. They laugh at me. I get on the bus and they watch me. I walk down the street and they watch me. I used to have dreams where i was an old man feeding ducks on my own in a park. I've accepted this as being almost symbolic of my life and future.

I stayed away from others due to the way they used to treat me. I don't belong around anyone. My Dad used to tell stories about people being racist to him (we are white) and how my brother was attacked for being white. I developed a rage towards non white people. It just ate me up. I'm better with it now but i still have moments where i get uneasy. 

I felt lonely too. I did not have many friends and stayed in a lot. I did a few years of therapy but it didn't do anything. I've had a couple of relationships but that was awful. I don't talk to them anymore. I've been drinking over the lockdown. Im miserable and just have a distaste for life. I hate people. I don't know what to do with myself"
MentalHealthUK,09/05/21 20:10:29,I really need help,"I'm struggling to see a GP. I can't get an appointment and 111 were not helpful. (MY OPINION, PLEASE DO NOT DELETE POST)
I just need to talk to my GP, I have done for months what do I do?"
MentalHealthUK,09/05/21 17:28:58,really struggling with politics + mental health (ptsd related triggers + trauma),"cw childhood trauma, transphobia, ptsd, bullying, police brutality

firstly, i'm gonna preface this by saying i'm not gonna go into heavy political rant and only stick to what is relevant to mental health.

i've been yearing to get involved in poitics for years here and have always struggled to my disabilities (i'm autistic and i struggle with other people). I'm also transgender which i don't disclose upfront when i post on here (outside of trans subreddits) but is relevant. Unfortunately for a variety of reasons it's a major PTSD trigger for me and i'm really not sure how to deal with it. this is because:

\- i don't trust the political left to be safe for minorities because the left won't do basic curation to get rid of bigots and if anything protect them. this has happened again and again to the point where it's a learned response. as a trans person this is particularly noticeable as every major party has issues with transphobia to the point where it's institutional (alongside blatant factionalism). I really struggle to talk to people in general as i need to verify that they're safe first and it's really difficult to do that.

\- i'm autistic and hence communicate very directly. i call a spade a spade and that includes a fascist a fascist, i state clearly somebody who dosen't possess enough basic facts to have an opinion etc. yet people think by being direct i'm implying that they're stupid, which isn't the case. i fully expect this to happen in every conversation now especially when factually i'm on the right side of the argument and they don't have any arguments left. this was especially the case when discussing brexit. I even make it clear i don't blame people personally at all because we can all be manipulated against our own interests. that is nothing to do with intelligence. yet people don't understand this (or want to understand) and this is by far the most traumatic thing.

\- ironically the trauma triggers now make it harder to regulate my conduct because i fully expect to be excluded from groups the moment they become uncomfortable with being held to account for their bigotry or believing misinformation (i tried for over 2 years to pander to NT sensibilities of civility, it does not work).

\- my abusive family have always tried to discourage me from getting involved in politics and have never gotten involved themselves, so i've never been able to go to events to get used to the environment and proceedures. additionally, they weaponised the police against me as a child to try to stop my autistic meltdowns hence i fear police brutality if i go to protests (i get panic attacks even when the police aren't personally looking for me).

\- i don't want to do online activism cause the trolling and bigotry is even worse on there (i had to delete an old twitter account and not be openly trans on there cause the terf sockpuppets got too much), plus at this point i don't think it will actually bring the major change needed (only direct action and sustained general strikes will). I fear the very binary nature of social media has warped my thinking and amplified my fears, but I don't have the offline support required to step back.

\- all this is despite the fact i fear for my future here every day and the hostile climate here has directly contributed to my mental health issues. this includes the fact i was rejected illegally by terfs when trying to go to a womens refuge for being trans, services intentionally lying and gatekeeping me from healthcare due to austerity to the point i had to go private for therapy and trans healthcare while i was still sofa surfing.

\- I eventually plan to leave the country, obtain another nationality and ditch my UK citizenship and never return. i cannot allow myself to give up on this goal as this is critical to my recovery.

i fear even trying to reach out again it's not going to be worth trying to navigate my anxiety if i'm only going to face further bullying, mocking and exclusion just for holding people to account doing basic community curation and get triggered to oblivion down the line.

has anyone been in any similar position? i apologise if any of this is too long or i go on too many tangents but i really don't know what to do to deal with this constructively."
MentalHealthUK,09/05/21 10:52:43,Breathlessness,"I have always suffered from anxiety and other vast mental health issues, however anxiety seems to be the one that gets to me the most. 

Recently, I’ve noticed I’ve relapsed with the feeling of anxiety and I can’t stop being short of breath. I keep thinking about it and it’s horrific, I keep thinking my throat is closed up and I can’t breathe. I am unsure as to why this is occurring as I’m also not sure what’s triggered me. 

I am healthy and have never had any health problems with asthma or anything but the anxiety makes me paranoid that I do, even though I don’t! It’s a crazy cycle and I m so scared of going through counselling/therapy again as a potential solution as I spent years through being a child in it and feel like I’m doing so well.

I’ve been taking Sertraline for a long time but can’t go on too high a dose as the last time it wiped me out badly.

Can anyone give me any advice or help? I am unsure what to do and need a kick up the bum to get me back to reality.

MentalHealthUK,09/05/21 00:37:29,How to relearn good habits after losing them to a mental health episode?,"Last year was a very bad year for my mental health, and a lot of my good habits were lost just because I didn't have the motivation to do them.

These include things like;  
Brushing teeth twice a day  
Washing face  
Showering   
Cleaning

I've tried to get them back, but as soon as I try forming one habit, all of the others I've tried forming start to deteriorate. So I wanted to know if anyone has any advice or methods on how to relearn and keep good habits for the long term?"

Why do some people have to be so horrible? like what do they get out of being that way.. do they enjoy it or something.. I get that everyone is different and has different views and such but some people are just horrible/evil.

I was meant to have a nice/relaxing week with no stress or upset but someone said something last weekend and I have seen it in the news a few times recently as well.. and it upset/annoyed me, and despite trying to have a nice week it was totally ruined by them and it took my mental health down a few levels again.. Now it just keeps going round in my head and in turn I was not very nice to a couple of people due to my mood being messed up.. and that makes me feel bad to because I'm not like that. .. Its not an excuse and I want to take back what I said to them because they were only trying to be nice :/

[m.me/dr.ravinder.arora](https://m.me/dr.ravinder.arora)"
MentalHealthUK,09/04/21 02:25:59,Ever feel doomed?,"I'm very aware of my negative thoughts after going through therapy, and generally I'm good at combatting them. It doesn't always change how I feel deep down, but it does make a difference to my attitude and everyday mood. When I have a bad day or moment though, I always get this sense of impending doom. I'm bombarded with future thinking thoughts like ""it's too late"" ""you're always gonna be like this"" ""there's no going back, you're going to be living with this for the rest of your life"" and ""the disorders are gonna keep piling up until you go insane"" and it honestly terrifies me. I know logically that these thoughts are extreme and likely untrue, but I panic and my body feels a threat, so I must believe it to some extent.

Ever since I was a kid I sort of thought I was destined to be sad. Now that I've dealt with serious mental illness, it's morphed into a fear about being destined to eventually lose all hope or stop functioning. I practice mindfulness but it's like the future has a grip on me and it causes visceral anxiety in my present. Idk, maybe I'm being extra dramatic today because I have a really bad cold and feel awful, but sometimes I worry that too much has happened to ever go back to the mindset I want to have. I accept this to some extent, that my depression and anxiety are parts of me that will come and go, but this tunnel vision is really scary because when I'm at my most vulnerable it pushes me towards thoughts that I usually wouldn't go near: ideation etc. No matter what I do there's always fear 

I hope it eventually passes. More than that, I hope I don't spend most of my life having to manage symptoms that take so much energy to keep at healthy levels. I always feel like I'm one terrible thing away from a complete breakdown"

MentalHealthUK,09/03/21 09:01:30,"Seriously, what is an alternative to CBT?","I'm currently in my FIFTH course of CBT. 

Third one this year. 

One as a group, one individual in person, one by phone, one by Skype and now individual in person again. 

I'm sick of complaining that CBT isn't helping because I always get the same three pathetic responses: 
""It can depend on the counselor, just try it again""

""Studies have shown CBT can be helpful for many people"" 

""Well what else do you want?"" 

I absolutely venomously HATE that last response. It's a cowardly unprofessional trick that avoids responsibility. I've asked ""What are my options?"" or ""What else can you offer?"" or ""Do you have any alternatives?"" or ""Something, anything, whatever is available. Please, anything, anything!"" 
And all I get is the same hollow cowardly response ""What do you think would help instead?""

I'm not a psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist, psychotherapist, sociologist, therapist or counsellor. It's illogical to expect me to know what form of counselling might help. 

Who has a better understanding of NHS mental health services and the overall field of psychology and mental health, a computer programmer literally begging for help or the person that works for NHS mental health services and (hopefully) has qualifications in it? 

Maybe there is some other option available that might help, but I won't know that unless I somehow already know what to ask for. 

So what are the alternatives to CBT?

Is there something else I should ask for? A different acronym, a different specialism, a specific technique or name I should be asking for?"

I love my person and I want to be able to give her hope that there is a better tomorrow.

MentalHealthUK,09/03/21 03:34:13,I can't tell if I'm being mocked or threatened,"Earlier this week I was doing a volunteer run session for mental health wellbeing. The practioner running the session offered to convey some of my concerns to my care coordinator as she is quite hard to get hold of and I'm basically not sleeping can't sit still and my coworkers have complained that I'm too fast and going off on too many tangents. 

We spoke today and I honestly couldn't tell if I was being mocked or if her saying she will speak to me in the morning was more of a threat.

She totally changed what she wanted me to do between now and my psychiatrist appointment and it was really hard to tell of she was annoyed with me (thinking I'm faking or exaggerating) or if she was basically threatening me.

I know in the past all the team has cared about is 1) Am I imminently going to commit suicide and 2) should I be driving.

I'm neither so I just feel really scared about the call tomorrow. I was pacing the whole time we spoke and trying to concentrate really hard at staying on topic and redirecting myself back but I know I was too fast, too loud and too excited.

Part of me thinks tomorrow morning I should just take some diazapam so I can better articulate what is happening but then doesn't that just feed into their faking/exaggerating? 

Also I really don't want taking off my meds because I can't go back to being depressed again.

Is this some kind if tactic? Like a test or is it just that accents and phones don't help to convey tone?"
MentalHealthUK,09/02/21 23:56:04,Have any other young adults in Somerset had experience with Connect18? (professionals DNI),"This is a pretty specific question so I'd be grateful for any answers, but I'm particularly interested in the perspective of anyone with a personality disorder or suspected PD.

For anyone unfamiliar, Connect18 is a relatively new bridging service between CAMHS and AMHS for anyone who's 17+, has been with CAMHS and meets the entry criteria for AMHS. As far as I'm aware this service only exists in Somerset at the moment, though there may well be plans to introduce it to other counties. 

Since it's so new they don't have a section on the Somerset NHS website and I haven't been able to find anything about them online. They've emailed me leaflets which provide a brief summary so I do know a little about what to expect. However, that's no substitute for being able to read first hand accounts.

I've only had three interactions with them so far (first contact, arranging a date for the initial appointment and the appointment itself as a video call). For context I'm now 18 and got dropped by CAMHS earlier this year. I spent the summer getting my autism and ADHD diagnoses privately due to the intolerable NHS waiting times. For me the best thing about Connect18 compared to AMHS is there's no waiting list. It's only taken a few weeks from the point I said I wanted to engage with them to have an appointment. This is ideal as I very much need support and answers sooner rather than later.

To get to the point, I'm seeking a psychiatric assesment for BPD/EUPD and I'll probably need DBT after that. Whether or not they can provide this is the key issue here (I'll have to go straight to AMHS if they can't). Connect18 doesn't actually have their own psychiatrists as the service was created out of existing CAMHS and AMHS resources. I've been told they work with whichever AMHS psychiatrist is closest to the individual. However, despite using the same psychiatrists, the support Connect18 offers is different to what AMHS offers. Apparently Connect18 have their own therapeutic programme and parts of it actually focus on PD symptoms.

This all sounds great, right? Well unfortunately both people I spoke to from their team also said PDs won't be diagnosed in people under 25. I was taken aback by this as 25 being the threshold is quite outdated. Most psychiatrists (including AMHS psychiatrists) will diagnose when someone's 18+. It's also becoming less unusual for teens to be diagnosed, especially in the US (for example in certain US states people can be diagnosed from age 12 onwards in some cases). Anyhow I'm not here to debate what the minimum age should be. It seems that whose care I'm under could impact whether I receive a diagnosis at this stage despite both services using the same psychiatrist??

I really need someone who's been through it to tell me if this is true! There's just no real reason why they can't be definitive at this age.



**TLDR: If you have any experience with Somerset Connect18 in relation to PDs, do they refuse to diagnose before age 25 even if you meet all the criteria? If this is the case, does the support they offer make it worth staying with them regardless? I'd also like to hear anything else about them you think is relevant.**

Fingers crossed this isn't too niche :')

MentalHealthUK,09/02/21 22:06:36,My inpatient stay is a really positive experience,"I have been an inpatient at an NHS mental health ward for about a week and a half.  I have a private en-suite room, good food at regular scheduled times, targeted occupational health support, meds reviewed weekly and given to schedule, lovely new friends and a feeling of gratitude and appreciation.   

Today I was allowed off the ward with my husband and dog for an hour and it was lovely.  When I requested a dog walk with my husband, they said it would be really good for me.   And it was!  


When I get discharged from here, I will continue to be supported at home too.  

I know that there is a postcode lottery for MH services and I am extremely fortunate to have a fantastic service in my area.

MentalHealthUK,09/02/21 05:23:04,"How do you get over the anger and grudge feeling of when you've been wronged by someone or an organisation and there's no justice, with them getting away with it?","I'm filled with so much anger and feel like I've got a grudge since I was put through so much mental distress and gaslit by a mental health organisation (and employees including their management) that was supposed to help me. They treated me like dirt and have just gotten away with it. They're a sort of large-ish organisation too so they won't be going anywhere and I'll probably see their name etc around, with them doing popups in places too. How can I get past this without any justice? I'll be reminded of them constantly. They caused me to have so many emotional flashbacks and I was re-traumatised and invalidated by them so much, as well as lied to, made false promises to etc.

It feels the same how what happened with the abuse I went through, when I would react to it and gaslighted from that reaction and told that I'm the bad one. What they've done makes me feel erratic/agitated and feel like I want people to know everything that happened, so I'd look like I was definitely so-called crazy if I see the organisation anywhere and try and explain what happened to others.

The thing is nobody believes me because the manager of that organisation put it on my record that I've got extreme paranoia and delusions so I'm fkd. It's not like I can argue against it because who'd believe me? I had one mental health nurse from another place dismiss what I went through (without even delving into what happened to me) and tell me ""well other people have been helped by them"" as if that matters lol, it's crazy. Just because others have had good experiences and not been abused/mistreated by them doesn't mean they treat everyone that way. They're supposed to be a caring organisation with professional career people and suppose to help people with mental health issues so people will automatically assume they're not bad because that's the image they give off.

Who would you believe, a place that's filled with therapists etc that's there to help people, or some person with complex trauma who's been in therapy and is now noted as having lots of paranoia? People will at the very least just say it's some ""transference"" rubbish and blame me anyway.

Can someone help me with this please and give advice or just let me know what you think? I don't know what to do here, thanks. They've put me through so much mental distress."

I don’t feel like I’m much better now than I was, but here it’s a safe environment and I can’t impulsively reach for anything that may kill me. 

What happens when you get discharged? I’ve been told I’ll see my care coordinator within three days and go back to seeing the crisis team regularly, but haven’t been told anything else yet. Will I get any sort of therapy? I have a discharge planning meeting tomorrow. Is there anything specific I should ask? 

The consultant last week said all my problems are due to being autistic and having some minor trauma and I’ll just have to stay on medication forever if I don’t want to get like this again. I found it very unhelpful! He didn’t suggest anything that could help me, and seemed to use autism as an easy answer."

MentalHealthUK,09/01/21 09:52:42,Is there anywhere i can get support to pay for a private psychiatrist?,"I've seen so many NHS psychiatrists that don't even give a diagnosis, give no insight at all into what's wrong with me, and most recently I've been told there's nothing else they could prescribe for depression. I don't think I've even been given a diagnosis. I've just pretty much been told there's nothing they can do, now fuck off.

I'm really at my wits end and I don't know what to do anymore. I can't go on like this, I need to get better but I feel like the people meant to help me are just trying to get rid of me.

I want to see a psychiatrist specialising in treatment resistant depression so at the very least I can get a diagnosis so I could participate in clinical trials. Or maybe they could say I don't have TRD but I might have something else so I could at least have a route to pursue instead of being in this constant limbo.

I can't really afford it but I was hoping people here could suggest something. Are there any charities that could provide funding, any loans companies for medical loans, or any health insurers that will actually cover pre-existing and chronic conditions?"
MentalHealthUK,09/01/21 01:18:23,Had a response from the Medical Director of my NHS mental health trust…the sheer arrogance! Help with what to respond with?,"Here is what he’s said in response to my complaint. If you’ve read my other post about my experience of a NHS psychiatrist and CMHT, then you’ll know what I’m complaining about.

His “two pennies worth”; 

“Thank you for your e-mail.
 
I note your previous communications with me, when you complained last year about the care you were receiving and the need for second opinion that was granted.
I also note your recent complaints and communication, as well as responses from Dr -.
 
In terms of addressing your care and complaint, against NHS standards, you will need to engage with Patient Experience Team to investigate your complaint in full, so that we could address any potential shortcomings in your care. I note you are reluctant to use this service.
 
In terms of your current care, as per response from Dr - and through my conversations with various professionals, I do not see any shortcoming in your care and therefore, I am not going to respond further to this matter or grant access to a further second opinion or any amendment to your treatment that has no clinical evidence base.
 
In future, please refrain from using derogatory language towards fully qualified psychiatrists. These psychiatrist have been selected through a highly competitive process that is monitored by Royal College of Psychiatrist.
 
I hope this is satisfactory; however, if you continue to think that you have a cause to complain, please do so via Patient Experience Team or else via Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.
 
Many thanks”

It is a truly laughable response. So he can request and affirm that I have to go through PALS and that he will not respond further on the matter, but I can’t do the opposite??? 

Of course he’s not going to say there’s been  any shortcomings in care, they can do no wrong. 🙄

And he says I’ve used derogatory language. 😆 All I’ve done is call them incompetent but because they have a qualification they’re infallible!? What bulls*it, as if no Doctor or Psychiatrist has been sued for malpractice. 

Moron.

Please advise me on what to respond with, any pointers?"
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 22:33:00,How can I request a specific consultant?,"I've had so many bad experiences with NHS psychiatrists. I've been under the care of 4 now. They've all been condescending as fuck. Over about 6 years we've just worked through all the dgs licensed for depression. Nothing has helped. I've also had extensive therapy which has helped in some ways to a small extent.

My GP referred me to another mental health team after about a year with no treatment. I had an appointment with a new doctor today who said he needed to speak to the consultant because I'd tried pretty much everything.

The consultant rang me back and said I'd tried everything they could prescribe. He said since I've tried so many treatments at my age (25) I probably wasn't giving them a fair try. Bullshit, I've stuck with some of these treatments for months despite horrible side effects.

He said there was nothing else I could try. The only option would be trying some of the stuff I've tried in the past again, and sticking with it for longer.

I suggested maybe we try pramipexole because there are case studies of it being used to treat anhedonia in people who haven't responded to other treatments, and there's a clinical trial going on right now for exactly that, but he said he's a doctor, he doesn't experiment, he only prescribes what the NHS says he can prescribe. Then he started talking about fucking serotonin and how thats the cause of depression so that's what we need to target.

I asked for a second opinion and he said he'd refer me to another consultant on the same team but I'm not hopeful. He also made a seemingly snarky comment about me wanting a second opinion after our 12 minute discussion.

I'm tired of being fucked about and looked down on by these people who have been failing to help me for a decade now but insist we have to stick to what the evidence says works. I can't keep living like this and my life is just passing me by.

But there's a consultant in my area who works for the Trust I'm under (not sure if she works on the same team I'm seeing though). She specialises in mood disorders and pharmacological treatment. I can't afford to see her privately, but I was thinking maybe I can see her on the NHS.

So is there a way for me to request to see a specific consultant? I have no idea how I'd go about it. I'd speak to my GP but its so difficult to get an appointment, and I'm not sure if they could do much now I've already been seen by the service."

MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 20:23:20,Don't know what to do.,I think I've been misdiagnosed. They say I have chronic anxiety and depression but I think it's BPD. I'm so unhappy. I don't have any support as it's ruined my relationships with friends and family and my partner. I'm feeling too low to even wait an hour to be answered on the phone to the doctors and I certainly don't want to walk to the doctors to make an appointment. I wanted a different GP at a different surgery which is why I find it hard to go down there. My current GP just gives me meds to treat the symptoms and not the cause. I've been waiting for an IAPT appointment for 2 years and still not any closer. I cannot afford to pay for therapy and my condition is worsening every day.  I don't know what to do cause I have a block stopping me from going to a doctor and everything I mean everything is a struggle to me at the moment.
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 20:16:39,"I've feeling more positive lately but I'm still waiting for treatment - if this treatment doesn't work, what happens next?","I've been under the secondary mental health team for a few years now and I should finally be getting my treatment in November. However, in the past I've had different treatments and only really ERP worked for my OCD. However, I think I'm depressed and may have BPD. I already have autism and OCD (actual diagnosis of them). 

My mood has been ok lately, still worrying a lot. For example, I'm worried about this horse. This horse lives on its own and without other horses. Horses are herd animals and should really have at least one more horse with it. I keep thinking what if my mum or sister's boyfriend is the horse? What if I can feel what that horse feels? The poor horse must be so lonely. I know it's a bit bizarre, but I can't stop thinking.

I got my letter from the psychiatrist saying I've got full capacity and insight, so I guess that's a good thing? However, because I do have capacity and insight, does that mean if the treatment for my mental health doesn't work that I won't be referred elsewhere? I know I've mentioned the autism unit before, but is that unit only for people who lack capacity and insight?

I'm just so worried about my future."
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 20:14:11,Someone I work with tried to end it all after a work party this weekend and only I know..,"My work mate ""Mr X"" He was really drunk, we left early and he stayed.  I text him the next day asking if he was alive. He found it quite humourous as he was sat in A/E after a failed suicide attempt..

He told me and one other friend and my wife and I picked him up and brought him home/offered help with food and if he needed anything after he had had tests done and so on.

Now I'm back in work and I'm struggling to not blurt it out while everyone is talking about how amazing it was and how funny Mr X was for being so drunk etc. Everyone assumes he's mega hungover.

Him not being in also puts more pressure on me to do more work with less people and my brain is already at max capacity with moving house and a baby on the way. 

I believe he has told my big big boss but yeah I just don't know what to do. 
Would it be wrong to tell a few trusted people? The burden of keeping this quite is absolutely collosal..

My wife and I tried to find resources for such a situation but didn't find anything.. anyways any advice would be great."
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 16:49:12,Therapy or medication?,"I’m fortunate enough to be able to afford private psychodynamic therapy. I’ve been having weekly sessions for three years.

About 3 months ago I stopped talking 10mg of citalopram daily.

Whilst therapy has helped me improve my relationships and understand my emotions, I still feel depressed, in the sense that I just don’t ever feel happy.

I am fortunate to live a very nice life - I have a supportive family, a good income, a lovely home and a wonderful husband and daughter.

I suspect that if I were to medicate I might be able to feel joy again. But it feels like a backwards step. I don’t want to be taking medication for the rest of my life.

In my position would you continue with therapy or rely on the drugs?"
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 09:28:44,Everything seems really overwhelming and disappointing,"I'm 18, currently out of school, plan on having a gap year before any decisions for higher education or something else.

Quick intro- talking about how I feel today and problems previously

On Wednesday I plan on learning to serve customers, take orders etc at my dad's take away. Initially I was patting myself on the back for taking myself out of my own comfort zone but now all I feel is dread.

I helped out with just deliveries today and I was feeling drained and pessimistic even before doing them. It didn't hinder my performance but something inside didn't feel right. I feel myself being sluggish even when I get back to the takeaway to do other stuff.

If I'm already dead working at my own dad's place, how do I expect myself to work somewhere else or study, I've just lost that belief in my self, I know some people are gonna say 'just think positively, it's all about mind set'. That's leads me to my next point:

I did some CBT sessions last December 2020, going over some strategies to take my mind of stuff to do with my ex after a break up in July 2020. Not gonna lie, still have hate in my heart but the thoughts of her don't affect me as much as before. I was never able to use the strategies until about 2 weeks ago.

I thought I was gonna become something great after I discovered my 'inner voice', whenever I feel anxious, something depressing or irritating me, I'd just tell me self that it's just some intrusive thought and it actually eventually went. I was so happy that I discovered this. I then went on to start journaling positive things that happened each day. I thought things were starting to look up... Fast forward to today, all the positive energy has disappeared I'm back at my low point and feelings.

Today and yesterday were the first times where I felt depressed as hell, almost at teary but not at that stage. I had nothing to be depressed about but it was just there, then I start to think of reasons which just fuels and makes it last longer.

My lack of ability to maintain consistency just edges me more and more to disappointment and hatred towards myself

Tbh I just don't know what to do anymore, the way I feel. It breaks my own heart to say this but:
1. I feel like I'm a lost cause
2. If I can't achieve anything, a good career, good income, able to afford nice things, what good am I? I have imagined myself becoming another news article."
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 07:26:51,How can you find out all information all services have on you?,"I'd like to know what mental health information all the services have on me, from the GP Practice to mental health organisations that give therapy on behalf of the NHS etc.

Is there some main central place that you email and they tell you what information there is in you? Also is there some main record place where it lists all things said by mental health people about you (from assessments etc)?

I had an unexpected meeting with someone from a mental health organisation without knowing I was being assessed or anything. In a following meeting they then told me stuff they thought about me from that last meeting and what they believed I had (which were wrong and also something that another mental health person disagreed with) but without me knowing, they've put it in a referral to another place, mentioned it to the Crisis Team and who knows what else they've done or who else they've told about their opinion.

I'd like to know how I can find out if I've got stuff on my record now from that unexpected meeting and things the mental health person thought about me. This is from a place that had mistreated me too so that's a big reason I want it removed if it's on some sort of record.

Due to their mistreatment (part of this is then ignoring my emails and calls) I don't feel comfortable contacting them myself so I hope I can find out what they've done and who they've told without having to involve them.

Can someone advise me on this stuff please? Thanks."
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 07:00:08,why do people really hate swearing so much? I find it liberating and funny and powerful /not a big deal but it really offends people and I want to understand why,"This might sound like a dumb question because obviously I understand swearing is usually used to insult people. But when I am not using it this way, and people still get offended at the use just in a general sentence is when I can’t really get to grips. Also I do understand it doesn’t matter if it’s no big deal to me, if it is for other people I should not do it. It’s hard bc I forget and then get told off and then feel shit but maybe if I could understand more then I would be able to control it better!  I’m pretty sure I have bpd/ocd/adhd/c&amp;ptsd so if that’s anything to do with it? Idk just trying to be a better person but it seems I can’t shut the fuck up"
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 05:33:57,Universal Credit Disability Trap,"Hi, this might be quite long but I think here is the most relevant space for it. 

I am currently on universal credit limited work related activity. I get an amount from that, then I work 10-20 hours a week self employed doing random stuff on the internet. (leaning to 15-20). In total £1050 from UC and then £300 from work and £200 to pension from work. (Specifically the limit of what I'm allowed). This then leads to a comfortable amount and secure income. (Work is great but extremely unreliable and part-time only). 

However, there are a few problems with it. 

\- Minimum wage jobs have become pointless for me as they are less money than UC and to be perfectly honest wildly unsuitable due to my illness (Schizoaffective). If they are not the full 40 hours - which most aren't - completely unsuitable and pointless. 

\- Cannot increase from this amount of money unless I find a full time job - this is ok, however, it has been almost 3 years since graduating and I haven't found a suitable and ""worth it"" full time job. Not for want of trying. 

\- Cannot save above £6000 - While this is 1. not a problem right now, I've just paid all my debt and am now saving and under this. 2. also unfair to full time workers. It leaves me in an awkward position - stuck in a trap. 

\- If I lived with a partner they would have to support me as my universal credit would be cut dramatically depending on their earnings. I am male and you can say whatever you want there is a massive stigma around this. 

It leaves me stuck in a trap - the Universal Credit Disability Trap! 

I'll never own a home - I'll never rent a moderate sized place - I can't afford to live with a partner - I can't afford to drive (banned anyway so meh) 

Stuck - Comfortable and secure - but absolutely bleh. 

I tried to work in a factory - didn't last a week. 

I am studying a Masters in engineering management but can't drive anywhere so it's kinda pointless. 

I am trying to teach myself web development and make a number of side projects alongside all of this. 

No one will hire me and I daresent tell the universal credit people about my websites though they aren't profitable yet. They know about my masters and work though and don't care. 

People say I'm a lazy scrounger (\*not my friends/family)... 

The stigma is huge... 

Even people complain I see that I smoke cigarettes and drink sometimes...

I don't really know if this is quite the right place for this and if not please direct me. 

I'm not quite sure what my next steps are meant to be? I got this far into rebuilding now my life is just going to be this? 

Idk...

I know this isn't really mental health but I'm looking for advice from people who have mental health conditions like mine (Schizoaffective) and in the UK."
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 05:20:52,What can I expect in a 2hr secondary services assessment?,It’s tomorrow. Not looking forward.
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 03:06:17,Please help me understand what's happening,"So I may have mentioned previously that I'm a little ""up"" currently but now I'm really confused by whats going on.

I keep hearing women's shoes walking on ceramic tiles, the noise even has that distinctive echo. 

Thing is I'm at home.

I spent last night trying to find the source of the sound but even outside my house has the wrong flooring. Both my neighbours only have carpet or laminate. 

Is this from exhaustion? I haven't slept much and when I have slept I've had awful nightmares so none of it has really been restful? 

I just don't know what to do, I'm sat here all twitchy waiting for the sound to reappear.

Does anyone have any ideas? suggestions? or answers?

I have also put this in r/bipolar as that is sort of my working diagnosis even though I don't get full mania so I can't have a full bipolar diagnosis. 

Thank you"
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 02:55:07,Hiya :),Here's a moral quandary for you: Holding for 111 whilst bloody puss drips down my arm. Should I call back and take the mental health option on the menu?
MentalHealthUK,08/31/21 00:35:36,Feeling overhwhelmed and lost whilst being caught in many catch 22 situations making it difficult to know where to start fixing my life.,"Throwaway because I do not want to be identified.

I feel completely overwhelmed and lost at 30 and do not know where or who to turn to or what to tackle first.

**Autism:**  
I’m fairly certain that I have a form of undiagnosed autism/Asperger’s which is creating other impacts on my life such as depression, anxiety and being unable to think clearly/brain fog. I often lie awake in bed unable to switch my brain off just staring at the ceiling or making pointless movements like rocking back and forth or side to side and I’ve noticed I sometimes do this when sitting down in a chair in the privacy of my own room but never in public. I also greatly struggle waking up at acceptable times like 7AM.

Due to my childhood trauma, I think I’ve also developed a case of both aboulomania and Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder, making it extremely hard to make both important life decisions and small simple decisions. 

I believe this aspect of autism and depression maybe running through the family, as I recall signs my mother was also depressed not only due to the sheer amount of alcohol she would consume, being over two bottles of wine and two packets of cigarettes a day, but on one occasion as a young teenager around the age of fourteen, I noticed packs of opened razor blades on her bedside table which when I asked about them, she wouldn’t give a straight answer and seemed ashamed or embarrassed to talk about.

My father has also explained that she would do odd things before I was born, such as go and sit upstairs in their bedroom when they had invited friends and family guests over and would purposely avoid these social event gatherings until the guests had left.

I believe she may have lost a child due to be born after me, due to picking up something heavy whilst pregnant at work, so this would explain the depression, and whilst she was drunk she also claimed she was abused as a child by her uncle although this is denied by her father.

My father didn’t have a particularly good relationship with his own father and was essentially absent during most of my childhood including on most weekday evenings becoming a total workaholic.

In addition, due to his wife’s drinking and constant arguments, he moved out when I was at the age of around 11 and didn’t really come back into my life until I was 21. Leaving me and my younger brother in the hands of my alcoholic and depressed mother who was emotionally and physically abusive to us, creating childhood trauma. 

As a result I feel stunted in my adult development and feel I never grew up correctly not being taught important life lessons or recieving the support you normally would receive from your parents who are supposed to look after you at this age.

Through none of birthdays such as turning 16, 18, or 21 have I ever had any kind of social gathering, party of meetup, I’ve essentially just sat in my family home.
When I turned 30 recently, my father started crying for some reason and I couldn’t honestly work out if it was a sense of guilt, disappointment, empathy or perhaps a mix of all three. I did ask why, but he didn't really give a straight answer.

Whilst I was a young teenager, My mother also told me whilst extremely drunk one evening that I was apparently considered borderline autistic by the doctors when I was born and they were not sure whether to send me to a specialist school or standard schooling. 

I would like to know if this is on my medical records anywhere, but it doesn’t appear to be. When I asked my father he downplayed it saying I was being paranoid and looking for excuses and went on to explain he felt getting a diagnosis would be pointless as it wouldn’t change my situation.

While I am not fully sure of the exact disability, my mother’s brother is mentally handicapped/disabled and unable to speak properly and requires a carer which further creates the suspicion there may be some kind of disability running through her side of the family genes.

When I have researched the aspect of autism and Asperger’s, any completed questionnaires and tests including assessments performed by Oxhleas NHS foundation trust have resulted in being highly likely to be on the autistic spectrum, however the sheer wait on the NHS to get diagnosed and the cost of a private diagnosis has resulted in no official assessments that I could use to receive employment assistance and support or any kind of benefits.

Any progression of assessment that I completed at the Oxhleas NHS foundation trust was stopped as I had to move back to my family home after moving out of the borough my student accommodation was in, as I was honestly struggling to work the two part time jobs, afford rent &amp; bills and progress in my post-graduate degree fulltime.

Whilst I do not hear voices, I do often spend a lot of time ruminating over things and having long thoughts and internal negative talks or discussions with myself such as thinking how possible scenarios will go or what I anticipate people to say when I talk to them.

I also suspect I have some form of OCD as I’ve developed a habit of checking things multiple times such as door locks and counting how many times I do this, such as making sure it ends on an even number otherwise I think for some reason bad negative things will occur.

Whilst all of this is going on, I’m experiencing a sense of falling behind and loneliness compared to my former peers my age and younger. 

Seeing people that I previously knew at University getting promoted into senior positions and purchasing their first homes on social media like Facebook and Instagram whilst I want to be be happy for them, in honesty it fills me with another sense of sadness. 

I completed my undergrad degree in August 2018 and moved back home in August 2019. I’ve hated living here ever since, feeling like a failure, with no freedom and independence and I can visibly see how disappointed and more frustrated the last remaining family member I have is getting with me on a daily basis. 

I’m trying to complete a masters degree but I'm going to fail for a number of reasons, some related to the mental health but others due to motivation and the degree itself not being as described. I knew this way back in October of 2018 but I was told that I would no longer recieve any postgraduate funding from Student Finance if I interrupted to change degree.

I desperately need to find full time employment in a graduate role that has the room for progression and advancement with a decent salary to save up enough money to get a deposit for a house and move out within a handful of years. 

I also need to either move out now or learn to drive as the family home I’m living in has no transport links to get any where near London and I also need to take better physical and mental care of myself.

Whilst I’ve held some IT jobs they've been mostly part-time and they’ve all been heavily tied to the university and the undergrad degree that I completed. I’ve realised the nature of IT support isn’t something I want to do and amplifies my mentah health problems, but I have nothing else as an alternative.

When I went to see a university counsellor last year in January 2020, her only suggestion was to move out of the family home as soon as possible but of course the pandemic then hit.

I’ve only had one real relationship before that lasted about two years but she had a fair share of her own mental health problems too. Two other women, who were interested at first, once they seemed to get to know me more they realised I probably wasn’t as well together as I first came across. 

The relationship with my ex girlfriend ended now two solid years ago so I naturally feel quite lonely and isolated with no desire to even try dating as I’m not feeling comfortable with myself and my life position but my university counsellor who I no longer have access to was surprised at me not dating for some reason.

I’ve always experienced a sense of FOMO/Fear of Missing out, particularly on Friday and Saturday evenings. For example, when staying in private accommodation at the University there would be a view of the London city skyline at night and viewing this would make me feel lonelier for some reason, especially when I would hear groups of students partying and playing music. Like I wasn’t taking part in events and activities I should be doing.

It’s also gotten to the stage where I feel unsure about how I’m seen in the eyes of other people. For example, people seem to look at me like something about me is a bit “off” or strange. I always feel there must be a reason, like I need to check myself like if I’m dressing in a weird way, if something is on my face or if my zip is down but there’s never any obvious reason like this, and I can’t tell if it’s a type of “He looks like he’s not right in the head” response or if it’s my own internal anxiety.

I recently explained just some of this to my GP in an eConsult questionnaire. Their response was to urgently ask me to phone a crisis line and self refer, but I thought this was only for people in immediate danger of taking their own lives? I admit I have had plenty of dark thoughts, but one of the questions clearly asked if I had put any of these plans in place to act upon them to which I answered no.

Reading about how badly the NHS is for mental health leaves me feeling so disheartened and as if I shouldn’t bother expecting to receive any help. As much as I would like to go private, I simply do not have the money with no full time job."
MentalHealthUK,08/30/21 18:23:58,Advice for managing negative self talk and feelings of loneliness,"Hi all,

I recently found this subreddit and I just wanted to say that this seems like a great community with lots of kind and helpful people. 

I was hoping to get some advice on managing negative self talk and feelings of loneliness and emptiness. I moved to the UK in January and was really struggling with depression and loneliness along with some major anxiety. The anxiety reduced a fair bit once I got going with the new job but the loneliness and depression remained. 

I've been depressed for a while and was managing it fairly well with medication prescribed by my psychiatrist back in South Africa in February of 2020 (pre-pandemic). I also spoke to a psychologist every few weeks on the phone since we were in a strict lockdown at the time. In SA I guess I had a decent support network - my flatmate (and good friend) and a few other friends (who while not particularly close, I could talk to). 

I moved to the UK on my own and didn't know anyone here. I did sign up for the CBT course and it was somewhat helpful but didn't address the loneliness issue, although I don't blame them as it's not something that was really focussed on. The strict lockdown in January and February didn't help and even once things warmed up and opened up I still felt as alone as ever. I go into work most days since our offices are open and I do talk to co-workers during lunch/tea but I still feel deeply empty. 

I know my health management in general has been poor. I found I was eating too much and exercising too little and I'm trying to work on that at the moment to at least lose some weight and get to a healthy weight again. I also know my sleep is poor (although that's been true for a long time) and I know that poor sleep can affect mood too. 

Generally, I tend to beat myself up about not doing enough at work or not doing enough to be healthy or not being enough to be a friend to anyone and most of the time I think it's fair to give myself the negative self talk since I'm clearly not succeeding. 

I've been trying to keep going and get out to go for walks and get some exercise and I know I don't have it that bad since I have the ability to work, even if I'm not doing great at it. 

Thank you if you read this far :) I would love to know if anyone has succeeded in fighting back similar feelings of loneliness and reducing the negative self talk and what worked for you. I would love any advice/readings/videos/audiobooks on managing these feelings of loneliness and the negative self talk. 

Hoping everyone is having a lovely and peaceful bank holiday. 💙"
MentalHealthUK,08/30/21 17:22:13,My mother needs help,"Hello all, thank you for taking the time to read this. I wrote this on mobile so sorry for any bad formatting.

I am seeking advice to help my mum. She suffered a very traumatic childhood which I shan’t go into detail about, but it’s left her with life time mental health issues. She has bipolar, PTSD and suffers with depression.

She is also a compulsive liar, and she is getting worse with it. She lies about little things and she lies about huge things. We usually humour her and just go along with it, but her stories are getting wilder and bigger and I just don’t know what to say to her anymore. She regularly tells me my dad and my brother have beaten her or done something awful to her and I know that it simply isn’t true. When she tells me these stories I honestly don’t know what to reply with because it’s never nice to hear something like that, and when you know it’s a lie what can you say? If I were to call her out on it she’d get incredibly defensive and argue with me.

Growing up her and my dad would drink together and argue regularly, and she would always be the one to instigate it. I have witnessed her hurting my dad physically, he has been covered in cuts, bruises and blood before and she never has a mark on her - he never retaliates. But, when she retells the story later it was always him who started it and her who was hurt.

There a lots of examples I can think of where she has changed the story and is trying to paint my dad out to be a bad guy, but I won’t go into them all.

She spends all of her days sitting in front of the TV with the curtains shut, some days she doesn’t even get out of bed. We try to get her out to places but she either refuses or agrees but then drops out at the last minute. It was my dads birthday yesterday and we went out for a meal with the whole family, but she made an excuse not to come. She bails on everything but then complains that she never goes anywhere, or that my dad doesn’t take her to places. I have invited her out countless times and she always says she’ll do it, but when it gets near to the day she has an excuse lined up.

I understand that depression is likely the cause of her not wanting to do anything, I just don’t know what I can do to help her. And the lies are getting more and more ridiculous, I feel like I can’t have a genuine conversation with her anymore because everything she comes out with is nonsense. She posts her lies on Facebook and then deletes them later, she tells her family and friends things too, so they must all think my dad is awful. And it’s not just stuff about my dad - she tells people about things she’s done that have never happened. I wonder if perhaps because she isolates herself she makes things up and truly believes them?

I’m not sure what the solution is, but if anybody has any advice I would really appreciate it, I am worried about her and I feel awful for my dad too.

Thank you."

MentalHealthUK,08/30/21 12:53:11,What to expect out of an assessment with CMHT?,"(TW: brief mention of self harm, suicide and weight loss)

For context, I’ve been trying to get help since May. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist since then but I need medication and treatment that goes beyond ranting once a week.

Initially, my GP referred me to Vita Minds (which I believe are a part of the NHS). Vita then held an assessment with me over the phone. At the end, they decided I need secondary care and a BPD assessment. I was really relieved to hear that (I’ve had an extensive history of therapists repeatedly ignoring me, claiming I exaggerate symptoms, blaming my hormones). 

Vita referred me to the Central Access Point. From there, I had another talk about my mental health. This is where I’m fuzzy on the details, but basically it was a referral to be seen by a professional or a team from the NHS itself. That was rejected and I felt defeated. 

Fast forward, I ask my GP to challenge it or whatever, just to get something out of it on a second try. I was told that unless I try at least 1-2 antidepressants, it’s unlikely I’ll have much luck. I’m genuinely repulsed by the idea of playing medication roulette. I’ve spent the last decade having symptoms ignored and going on cocktails of drugs which caused a 30 pound weight gain. I’ve lost 50 so far now, and I’m afraid of jeopardizing that. 

I dont remember but I called 111 during a panic attack a few weeks ago, to which ultimately resulted in me finally, FINALLY getting a CMHT assessment. 

My biggest fear is that the appointment will be fruitless. That the person will assume things based on my appearance. I’ve had experiences where a therapist had me fill out online forms to get an idea of where I need help, only to disregard the entire thing because “I don’t look like I struggle with suicidal thoughts or self harm”. This event was 3 years ago. I’m in a much, much worse state now. I’m really afraid I’ll somehow mess up and maybe wait another 4.5 months to even be considered for a second try.

My question is: would it be stupid to show up with notes? Something written? Is it prudent to say something like “I think I might have ____” or “I want to go over the possibility of ____”. I sometimes feel like if I bring up something to a MH professional, they’ll accuse me of self-diagnosing. Or that somehow I’m insulting their intelligence by laying down the cards if that makes sense.

However, showing up empty handed makes me very nervous. I have ADD and Dyspraxia, I *need* to have a list of some sort. 

And as a backup plan, if this does end badly, what the hell do I even do? My poor mental health nearly caused me to fail university and impacted my physical health greatly. I’m just nowhere near willful enough to go through it again.

And what should I even expect? What are peoples’ experiences?

Sorry about the long post, I’m just in the worst place I’ve been mentally probably ever and one more fuckup is just . I cannot handle it."
MentalHealthUK,08/30/21 11:42:50,"""Talking therapy only works if you can talk""","I've struggled with mental health issues for my whole life. I haven't been able to work for the last 5 years.

I really dislike having people in my house, even friends. Over a month a go, we had tradesman start on a job that they said would take 2 weeks. What I ended  up doing was just staying in my room while the workers worked. It was very hard, and it went on for a full month. It really brought to the forefront that I was only ""ok"" because I created a bubble for myself.

I've been on a lot of different meds and been sent to a lot of different therapies over the years, but the meds don't seem to help, and I can't talk during therapy.

I'm not sure what I'm really looking for, but I've attempting again to get help (got a phone call with my gp in 2 weeks) The issue I have with therapy is when I go it feels like an attack. Even typing about it is making me start to feel warm and my muscles starting to tense up like I'm bracing for an impact. In session, it gets so bad I have to physically restrain myself to keep myself in the room and everything feels so tense I end physically not being able to talk.
Even beta blockers or diazepam don't help with that

I'm just worried that I'm running out of options and I really don't have the fight in me it feels is needed to not get fobbed off."

MentalHealthUK,08/30/21 03:24:43,Can’t cope with new job.,"Can someone please give me some advice? 

I recently started a new job and it’s decent money, but I am really struggling with it. I cry during every shift and vomit with anxiety every morning. The past few months I’ve been mostly fine mentally, but with my new job I can feel things slipping and there’s no way I want to fall back to where I was. 

I really want to just quit but people keep telling me not to do it till I find another job, but I really don’t think I can hold out. I’ve been signed off for two weeks and due to go back on Tuesday but I’m sat here crying and feeling nauseous thinking about it. I would ask to be signed off longer but I’m really worried about what my friends and family think of me. I can’t handle their judgement. 

I just don’t know what to do. I want to do what’s best for me, prioritise myself, but I don’t want to disappoint anyone."

I just wanted to say I struggle with mental health on a daily basis with things such like depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts which is mostly based off my appearance as I do not have any hair cause of alopecia. I know there are a lot more people out their that are dealing with the same problems or similar.

I've created a short 5 minute YouTube video on why and how I feel this way, further on explaining solutions and rationalization from what I've come to learn and find out.

MentalHealthUK,08/29/21 15:24:03,Really worried about starting uni in September and having suicidal thoughts again,"Shitting myself because i'm starting unі soon and I had a shit secondary school experience. Made 0 friends, got bullied and i'm worried I fucked up the rest of my life. I have poor social skills, no social media presence, social anxiety and a speech impediment. I don't think i'm gonna make any friends because of these factors and it's just gonna be a repeat of school. Plus i'm worried about other stuff like living in a different part of the country and failing my degree.

I had suicidal thoughts for a few weeks in February and again on my 18th birthday in late April and early May. But I didn't tell anyone about it. They've come back now but this time I want to see a therapist or at least talk about it with someone. It's hard to see my future being any better than the present because of my school experience and i'm really scared of the thought of going outside of my comfort zone and trying to socialise with people at unі. I just think i'm gonna be alone forever. Also I feel like even if I have the best unі experince possible I still won't be happy with my life. I never really got to experience being a teenager. I missed out on a very important stage of my life."
MentalHealthUK,08/29/21 09:09:07,What should I do?,"I personally have mental health issues stemming from Autism, and my previous use of cannabis. I really need help with my mental health from a specialist but can't afford to pay privately as I don't have a job, and so am on state benefits. What complicates matters is that I'm planning on starting a college course and have a criminal record, limiting me to part time jobs with employers willing to take the risk, which won't pay that much anyway. As the NHS are unable to help, given that they don't recognise me issues as ""existent"" at all, despite criminal justice psychiatrists doing so, then what should I do?"
MentalHealthUK,08/29/21 08:12:41,Angry at the system,"I really want to commit a crime against the system to 1) make a point about how corrupt it is and how much I want it to go away and 2) get the mental health support I need. The reason being that as an ordinary member of the public, I am entitled to nothing. Once I enter the system however, I know I could get mental health support as a probation requirement, and potentially even avoid prison entirely if I play my cards right i.e. don't do any serious shit. Why shouldn't I go ahead, and given that I want to commit a crime anyway, which one should I do? My plan is to stop a Police officer doing their job by following them around repeatedly. If that fails then I will chant ""SHAME ON YOU!"" repeatedly. I would only do that if the Police were doing something that I considered unjust i.e. anything other than preventing or dealing with violence. What do you think?"
MentalHealthUK,08/29/21 06:20:21,Understanding how mental health plans work in the UK.,"Hey guys, just your friendly Australian here. I have a really close friend going through it. She had a phychologist and she had just started making progression but stopped due to family concerns. It's really taking a toll on her, she's worse then ever before. I think she really needs to talk to a professional again. But she won't bother, she said that she's ineligible to apply for another few months. In the end of the day I can't push her, shes juggling with a lot. But I do want to understand what she means by this. How long does it take to apply for another subsidised mental health plan. How long is processesing, how many times can it be applied, especially once already given and how is it subsidised?"
MentalHealthUK,08/29/21 04:47:24,Help I am so confused by every suggestion I've gotten from NHS and also my GP!,"My  GP gave me four links for therapy (for my depression). One of them said  explicitly it was only online. The other three seemed like they could  work out. They were all under the NHS. I had filled out self referals  for the other three, and two let me book a telephone assessment after  calling back. One I've already had and the other only had one in late  September. The other called up and said that they were only online. The  one that I had the phone assessment with, said right at the end of the  assessment that I had to choose between phone calls and face calls...  now I could never open up over the phone, I have nowhere private to  myself and I hate speaking on the phone. Infact, I've had to face up to  my fears by calling up just for therapy. The other thing they said, is  that I wouldn't be able to talk about my past to this therapist, only  what to do next... this confuses me because my past is very vital to my  current feelings, and I want someone to talk to because I have nobody  else. What else is therapy for but talking about your feelings and past  traumatic events? It would be helpful or better than nothing since I'm  struggling with doing anything in my life, but the waiting list is going  to be months and months, and I hope to get my life together before  then. Is it impossible to see therapists in person? Is it impossible to  find a psychologist who can help me with all my problems, I need an ear,  I need help. I am so scared because I struggle to do anything, and I'm  scared if I go back to work that I'll lose the will to live completley.  I'm 20, I am ashamed to say I can't figure this out for myself. It  confuses me so much, every bit of information, and on the phone  assessment they wanted me to decide everything immediatley. I can't say  my life is in danger because then I'm scared of the repurcussions... and  especially over call I could never say it over call. I think you can  see I'm on my last string here, I would never think to ask for help on  Reddit but I don't know what else to do anymore, nobody can seem to give  me the right advice. I don't care if I'm on a waiting list as long as I  know it's for the right thing, so to be clear, I want a therapist who  does cognitive behavioural therapy, who can lend me an ear about my past  and present, and who I can see in person. With all the restrictions  lifted in UK, I thought this would be possible. I know I'm not more  important than others, I just need to know what my options are."

MentalHealthUK,08/28/21 22:53:23,I feel so alone.,"I have a lot going on right now and nobody seems to be able to give me the support I need except professionals. They're not always available, so much of the time I feel very alone. 
I am dealing with a new job (more responsibility, and a new team), a house move, and a court case (past trauma) all at once. I am under the care of the CMHT which is a good thing, no complaints. Awaiting the start of CAT therapy and an appointment with consultant psychiatrist. Those are positives, but the waiting is excruciating. I'm also on the list for an adult autism assessment, recommended by my care coordinator.
I guess what I'm trying to get across is that a lot is going on, I feel overwhelmed, and the right support isn't immediately available 24/7. I do have suicidal thoughts and wish I could just have a hug. There isn't anyone in my life who could provide that. I feel increasingly desperate and am constantly shutting down. I know I can ring the crisis team but I just feel like there's nothing they can do for me. I feel like a child trapped in an adults body."
MentalHealthUK,08/28/21 20:46:47,I don’t want to seem unco-operative,"So I had a text from my GP surgery this week “We have received a letter following your appointment with the mental health team.
Pls book a routine telephone appointment with a doctor to discuss medication.”

Ok cool, book a telephone appointment and the GP said “we have to decrease your Amitriptyline until it’s stopped and increase your venlafaxine to 375mg…serotonin syndrome blah blah blah”

The amitriptyline is for my migraines which I’ve suffered without 20 years, I’ve tried many different meds over that time and this one works for me.  I’ve tried coming off of it on two separate occasions, migraines returned with a vengeance.  My last migraine was last week for three days, before that I had one in January - 7 months between attacks is honestly a blessing.

GP agreed to not change anything for now and I phoned the MH team to tell them my concerns.  After my last assessment it was agreed I would be referred to a specialist personality disorder unit (super on board with this!) but I’m worried they won’t follow through with this if I don’t agree to change my medications…and very aware I won’t hear anything until at least the end of next week after the MH specialists have their weekly meeting.

It’s put me really on edge, which is my own problem really, but it’s all I can think about.  I’d like an outsiders perspective on this perhaps?

MentalHealthUK,08/28/21 19:23:42,I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology from abroad. Any tips on how to start my career in the UK? More details below,"Hi, 

I'm from Southamerica, I already hold a degree in Psychology with a specialization in clinical psychology. At the end of my degree, I had a placement for over 7 months having three patients weekly. 

I wasn't sure about being a psychotherapist so I decided to try other careers and now I work in marketing and I came to London to do a Master's degree in Media and Communications. However, I now realized what I really like is psychology and being a therapist. 

I've been doing my own research and to work in the NHS you would need a qualification accepted by the UKCP or BPS, and what I've seen is that those qualifications take at least 3 years part-time. 

Does anyone know if there's a short master's degree with a psychodynamic approach that would let me work as a qualified therapist or if there's any route that I'm missing that I could do to start changing careers?

Thanks in advance,"

https://www.wearehumen.org/the-humen-space/

Considered a “Gym for the mind”, I was part of the HUMEN Space Online and got to talk about mental health issues (depression, anxiety, panic attacks) openly without any fear, shame, stigma or rejection. I returned regularly and got to meet some really great supportive folks from across the world.

The In-Person sessions are looking to start again on Monday 13th September, 6:30-7:30 PM and the deadline to register is Monday 30th August, where they need to have at least 15 attendees to commit to 6 weekly sessions. 

Link here: https://wearehumen.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92f1f6719f23a43f6defc4843&amp;id=1cccadc4c1&amp;e=55ff5d3d34

Due to the success of The HUMEN Space Online, these sessions will continue to run on Zoom alongside the in-person sessions every Monday 6:30-7:30 PM."
MentalHealthUK,08/28/21 07:29:01,Without merit,"Last night, I saw a thing about a girl who was working as an emergency medical dispatcher and training to become a paramedic. She had just gone for a walk after giving a couple instructions to save their baby's life. She spoke about how she was a carer for her brother, and her dad was sectioned and later died, and how she wanted to do something that would make him proud. She was in her 20s maybe?

People go through so much. They go through genuine hardship, loss, trauma, real bad stuff in life and yet still manage to do amazing things. 

I had appendicitis, flipping appendicitis, nigh on eight years ago, and I broke. My mental health has been bad since and gotten worse. That's all I've been through, I've not experienced loss (other than pets) or trauma or hardship, never broke a bone or anything, and I was laid low by an illness so many people have and are fine. Seems like a testament to my inadequacy.

I am not good at anything, I have no positive features or anything to offer anyone. I never have done, but I guess I've just gotten worse and worse. I just bring people down, I'm ""draining to talk to"", so I try not to subject people to me anymore; it took a few years to realise that I have nothing to offer anyone so it's just selfish to expect people to want anything to do with me. I'm ugly as hell and, as you can probably guess, I've never had a girlfriend at 21. Not that that's surprising.

With OCD as my main diagnosis I guess, you'd think ERP would've been helpful, but it never seemed to be. I was on a ward for a while, and the OCD stuff seemed to recede for a while while the numbness and fogginess developed, but one little thing caused it all to come back full force and no techniques or medication seems to be able to hold it back anymore. Group therapy didn't seem to help either.

If it was a trauma thing, maybe EMDR would help? But it didn't, the lady I did it with stopped it she said it wasn't helping.

It seems like I'm just broken on a fundamental level, like maybe I was really supposed to die all those years ago and something went wrong and now I'm a ghost in a living body, a burden on my family, on society, on the world. If my family weren't such good people, if they didn't care about me, I'd probably be gone already and the world would probably be a better place.

Sorry for such a long moaning post. Just burdening more people yet again. Thank you if you did read it through, just sorry for wasting your time

TLDR: Ghost in a living body, worthless waste of space who ruins everything, moaning"

MentalHealthUK,08/28/21 05:44:11,It’s ok to be shy / quiet as an adult right?,"I’m just looking for some reassurance I guess. I’m 24 surgical nursing student.

Learning to become ‘normal’ seems impossible. My uni have asked me to sort it out before I come back (they forced a temporary withdrawal, to return in January if I’m deemed fit enough) and I thought I’d made great progress over the summer but one of my friends (yes, a friend) returned home to our accommodation yesterday and I have never been so genuinely terrified in my life.

I freeze whenever I hear movement, I can’t talk at all anymore, it’s taking me an hour to just leave my room to sneak 4 metres to the bathroom. I’d be starving if my landlord hadn’t brought me food. I’ve never been this bad before.

I honestly don’t mind living like this, it’s like my whole personality and tbh I’d be lost without my anxiety and self-neglect. But my uni are saying I pose a danger to my patients if I don’t change. Which is a fair concern I guess but there’s no proof I can’t be great at my job. And changing my whole personality just seems such an impossibility at my age. Or maybe my self-destructive side is just saying all this because I know I’d be better off if I were different.

I love my future nursing job more than anything ever and if I fail now not only will I lose it forever, I’ll probably also be thrown onto the streets to die.

I have a lot of thoughts but struggle to put them into words so I’ll just leave it there for now. (I just need to post it already before I end up deleting it all again)"
MentalHealthUK,08/28/21 03:03:51,Concerned / vent about NHS IAPT therapy quality,"Sorry, this is probably more of a vent than anything.

I've been on the waiting list for a while and have just had an email through from them to arrange my first appointment for the first of the six ""low level intensity therapy"" phone sessions. I suspect I'm finally being seen because on the questionaire they send out each time my score on the suicidal feelings / plans scale has been higher and higher each time, but despite that they are still sticking to only putting me in for ""low level"" which I was told is just general coping techniques rather than therapy. Is that right? Surely it's at a point where they need to consider actually starting the therapy rather than wasting time with sessions of generic coping tips? As it stands it means I still won't get actual therapy from them until the end of the year at the earliest (I'm assuming they probably have a shutdown over the xmas period too).

I'm also a bit concerned that the practitioner has claimed in the email/letter that they haven't been able to get through on the phone, despite there being no missed calls or voicemails on my mobile (I know they've got the right number as they phoned me on it for the consultation originally). Next they've dated the letter/email today (27/08/21) and said that if I don't get back to them within one week from the date of this letter (by 01/09/21) then they'll discharge me and I'll have to refer and wait again. Now I'll phone them back on the Tuesday so it'll be ok, but how can they say that 01/09/21 is a week later, when it's only 5 days, 3 of which they're closed for because of the weekend and bank holidy?! And it wasn't even sent till 4.54pm today, so it's not like I even had a chance to get back to them today! Between the long waiting times, and the fact they haven't actually tried to phone and are ready to quickly discharge me for lack of contact, it feels more and more that the attitude and system for mental health just doesn't care and is along the lines of ""leave them long enough and they'll give up (or worse)"".

The letter is also signed off with the persons name, followed by Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner Trainee, is this person likely to also be the one assigned to conduct the treatment? I get that everyone needs to train up at some point, but I'm a bit concerend at the quality of treatment I might recieve, scoring higher each time on the depression &amp; suicidal feeling scales I would have thought they'd maybe allocate me to a full/experienced practitioner. What worries me is if the trainee can't even get things like the number of days between dates right, and they claim they've phoned when they haven't (or have dialed the wrong number and didn't think/bother to check and try again), then are they actually going to be any good at trying to help? I'm quite worried they're going to be like lots of crisis lines I've spoken to in the past, where you can basically just hear them reading from generic scripts and conversation flowcharts. If that's the level of treatment then what's the point of any of this?

Maybe I'm overthinking it and I've got it all wrong, but it's not really feeling like this service is going to be much help (especially not this first phase of ""low intensity"" treatment)."
MentalHealthUK,08/28/21 00:59:35,"My experience complaining to my Mental Health Trust, Please read for insight and provide advice.","I originally complained to the Clinical Director for my area back on the 22nd of July 2021 regarding my previous psychiatrist washing her hands of me and not seeing me for a review. The Clinical Director, surprisingly, responded to me straight away and we had a telephone conversation about my concerns. I have a complex case and have tried multiple medications and requested an experienced Psychiatrist. 

Instead, I got a “Junior” Psychiatrist, who I saw this past Tuesday. She was clueless, arrogant and dismissive. I’m currently on Moclobemide and a benzodiazepine, which is not effective and she would only switch me to a different benzo, which is moronic. After the appointment, I complained to The Clinical Director again, instead now he began to ignore my emails and requests for a phone call. In my email, I complained about the psychiatrist, and requested a second opinion. He eventually did email me back saying he would not give me a second opinion and he agreed with the psychiatrists assessment (as if he would say otherwise). 

He then said that any further concerns should be sent to the Patient Experience Team (PALS). Now I don’t know if anyone has complained to this “complaints team” before, but they are nothing but a messaging service, who send the complaint to the lowest manager within your team to respond. They are biased and not independent from the Trust, so they are not working in your best interest. It’s a complete waste of time going through them. 

I have since sent further emails to the Clinical Director in response to his view and CC’ed in people on the Trust board including the Managing Director, COO, and Medical Director. As of yet, none of them have responded to me, or are likely to, as they hide behind PALS and never hold any accountability. 

It’s atrocious that these people think they can do this and hide away in their ivory towers whilst mental health patients sufferer. We pay for their damn salaries through taxes, we deserve to get help from them and for them to resolve these matters.

MentalHealthUK,08/27/21 05:57:20,"I have Kienbocks disease and probably going to need surgery on my wrist and 4 months in a cast, I'm terrified.","I've had wrist pain for a couple months now and after getting fully vaccinated I decided to get it checked out at A&amp;E, after getting it X Rayed it turns out I have Kienbock disease. A bone in my left wrist is smaller then it should be, which is putting pressure on a second bone, and that second bone is dying. 

A referral has been sent to my GP for me to see a hand specialist, and from what I've been able to find about the disease online, I'm going to need surgery on my wrist and be put in a cast for 4 months. If I'm lucky after all of that, I'll retain most of the mobility in my left wrist. If I'm  not lucky and the disease has progressed far enough, I could end up  losing a lot of my wrists mobility and have to drop a good few things I love. 

At the very least, I'll probably be without my left wrist/hand for 4 months, and I'm trying to keep calm about all this but I never realized before just how many things I did that used both of my hands.

MentalHealthUK,08/26/21 17:28:56,Swapping antidepressants again - advice,"I was started on Fluoxetine early May after being on Sertraline for 6+ years. Since increasing to 40mg I have been unable to sleep for longer than two hours at a time so made a plan with my GP to swap meds again. Currently down to 20mg for a couple of weeks and then to decide what one to go. I have been on Citalopram before which I did not find beneficial. Sertraline worked the best before it just stopped working I guess. 

When switching last time I did ask the GP about Escitalopram and she said it’s not usually prescribed? Is anyone aware of this being the case in the UK (I’m in Yorkshire)? I have also been wondering if there would be any benefit in restarting Sertraline maybe? Has anyone got any experience in going back on a previous antidepressant that was working until it wasn’t?!"
MentalHealthUK,08/26/21 08:38:23,Fair cost of private therapy,"Hi everyone,

This is reposted from r/MentalHealthSupport

I've been seeing lots of posts recently involving the difficulty of finding appropriate help with mental health in the UK (and other countries) because of the price of treatment outside of NHS and NHS services being unhelpful. I'm curious what people would consider affordable for telehealth services in the UK. I know that there are different regulations in UK and US and many US therapists might be able to work with UK clients that don't have access to better alternatives. Many people have said that UK therapy tends to cost between 50-60 GBP for private pay. Is this accurate? What would be affordable?"
MentalHealthUK,08/26/21 03:13:26,Just got told my wait for CBT on the NHS will be about 12-15 months - what are my options now?,"About a month ago I went through my GP who referred me to the county mental health team as I am losing the plot in all honesty. Since then, I've had 1 30 minute call, 1 text and 1 email with a load of generic information I already knew regarding depression/anxiety. I then asked what comes next as I am unravelling and need help - they told me you will be contacted by someone regarding starting CBT but it will be about a year from now because of the waiting times. I just sat there in silence for about 30 seconds trying to process what I just heard.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't meant to be bashing the NHS people trying to help me at all, when I have been spoken to they sounded like they genuinely cared and I know they are underfunded and very busy. Nor am I trying to cut the queue because I respect other peoples problems too, but to hear that I wouldn't be getting ANY help for a year when I really need it right now has just thrown me into panic and an unknown place.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at going private but the prices are just....absurdly high and are way out of my budget. Has anyone been in this position or is anyone in this position right now? What did you do? What should I do? I'm lost and feel very alone.

MentalHealthUK,08/26/21 02:54:09,Mental health support,"(Topics of self harm and suicide within)

Bit of context - I’m 25/m from the UK. 

So, I’ve struggled with mental health since around the age of 13, self harmed almost daily for the last 10+ years, attempted suicide once after my Grandmother passed away (it was the first loss I had experienced and didn’t deal with it too well). I’ve been on and off of medication for several years, and am currently taking medication to try to ease daily struggles. 

In the past few weeks my mood has dipped again after being steady (not high but not low) for a couple of months. Where there have been dips I have requested for the medication to be increased which my GP has done. 

I don’t really have any friends outside of work colleagues and am not close enough with my family to bring up in conversation that I’m struggling again and am getting urges to self harm again, after almost 12 months of not doing so. 

Suicidal thoughts have been a daily occurrence for the 10+ years I’ve been having issues, but haven’t acted on them again as I now have a child who will be 3 in March from a previous relationship that didn’t work out. However, the urge to do something again is slowly creeping in again and is getting to the stage it was when I did try. 

I guess this isn’t really a cry for help as I don’t think strangers on the internet are in a huge position to help, but more of a reach out to others who have potentially been in a similar situation and have any words of wisdom.

MentalHealthUK,08/26/21 00:52:29,Question: Studying Medicine with PTSD,"22F.  I am going to be studying an MB ChB (medicine) in the UK, but I have a history of trauma and PTSD. My chosen university want to assess whether I am fit to study as it is a very demanding course. It is a conditional offer subject to them deeming me fit enough to study. 

I have been ok with my PTSD and I am self-managing my symptoms well, but the university wants a letter from my GP to prove this. My GP does not have my medical records on their system and it could take them a while to access it and I run the risk of missing my deadline to be passed as fit to study by the university. The GP says they cannot do an assessment on me without my medical records, so I would need to wait for them. But I cannot wait any longer without risking losing my place at medical school.

I am wondering, is it possible for me to be assessed privately by a licensed psychiatrist or medical doctor who will then be able to provide my university with information on my PTSD symptoms and how it is managed? Is this something that is feasible?

I appreciate your help and advice in advance. Thanks!"
MentalHealthUK,08/25/21 23:12:01,New to anti-depressants - what should have I expected?,"I’ve been on Citalopram since around November last year - I’ve struggled with depression since my teen years but only reached out to a doctor last year after it worsened.

I had to do an e-consult, I expected the dr to call me to discuss but she just text me saying she was putting me on 20mg Citalopram and to contact again in 3 months for a review. After the 3 months, I again expected a phone call, but again just received a text bumping me up to 30mg.

The 30mg has helped, but because I’ve actually had no discussion with a doctor I honestly don’t know what should have been the desired outcome.

Pre medication I would say I had moderate to severe depression, and now 10 months on, I would say I can live a pretty normal day to day life (so, that’s good!)

BUT every 2-4 weeks or so I’ll have phases, ranging from a couple of days to a week, where I’d say my depression is much much worse. I can spend 3 days in bed without eating, changing, any sort of hygiene etc, it gets pretty tough. But it only lasts a short time and then back to normal-relatively-happy life.

The thing is, I have no idea if that’s normal on anti-depressants? Should I be expecting these ‘down days’, or is it a sign that my medication isn’t working as expected?

I really just want to know whether I should try and speak to a doctor, or whether this will always happen with any anti-depressants and I need to look for other coping mechanisms to get me through the rough days.

Thanks in advance!"

If you're suicidal and still able to think half clearly, get yourself to an A&amp;E and tell them ""I'm scared I will kill myself"". 

If you can't get yourself to the hospital, call 999. Don't worry about wasting ambulance time, they will judge that. 

Whatever happens, ask them if they can give you a summary of the event (they usually do, but make sure of it) and send a copy to your GP. 

If this happens a few times, your GP will have to start doing something and you will get referrals and possibly bumps up the list. If nothing else, you'll get visits from crisis team who might provide you with resources. And when they do give you help, ANY help, please try to use it to its full extent without dismissing it as useless.

Generally, it would be insightful to hear people's experiences as a whole within the NHS treatment, as well as other treatment and support you were offered that you found both helpful and unhelpful.

I had a review today with an NHS psychiatrist, a different one to the one who’s been under my care for the past year or so, as she has fobbed me off and left me with no care. I waited 5 weeks for this appointment (urgent due to how bad my mental health is). After wasting an hour she refused to prescribe me a different medication. 

Current Medication:

Moclobemide150mg Tabs – 2 in the morning &amp; 1 @ lunch
Clonazepam 500mcg Tabs – 1 OD/PRN (as required)

Past Medication:

Clomipramine 10mg Caps 3 @ night
Escitalopram 10mg Tab – 1 a day
Escitalopram 20mg Tab – 1 a day
Escitalopram 5mg Tab – 1 a day for 1st 14 days then 10mg a day
Fluoxetine 10mg Cap – 1 a day
Fluoxetine 20mg Cap – 1 in the morning
Mirtazapine 15mg Tab – 1 at night
Paroxetine 10mg Tab – 1 daily
Paroxetine 20mg Tab – 1 in the morning
Sertraline 50mg Tab 1 daily
Venlafaxine 37.5mg M/R Cap – 1 a day then increase to 2 a day after 2 weeks
Bupropion 150mg M/R Tabs 1 Twice a day
Vortexetine 10mg Tab 1 daily
Modafinil 200mg Tab  - no dosage listed  

The psychiatrist would only increase my Moclobemide and give me another benzo.

MentalHealthUK,08/24/21 23:14:42,Feeling bored and disinterested,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

My mental health is up and down regularly - it never gets very serious, just bouts of feeling stuck in a rut/bored/disinterested.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having one of those now - feeling bored of well, pretty much everything. Not really taking much of an interest in playing sports/videogames/reading which id usually be very keen on, and more worryingly im getting more disinterested with work - which im usually very ontop of and enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend most of my time just flicking through stupid bloody tiktok/instagram videos or on reddit/forums just killing the day until work is over (where i've achieved 0) and i can continue to do that without feeling guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to delete those apps as i think they are just turning my brain to mush - any other suggestions/advice for being in this situation? I feel like i need a reset."
MentalHealthUK,08/24/21 23:02:45,How on earth do you actually get help?,I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and I'm trying so hard to get help but my gp just makes me self refer to iapt and then I get nothing back.

MentalHealthUK,08/24/21 11:36:08,I developed a mental health related app from my personal experience!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

I have created a subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/Happyer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Happyer/) to help easily address issues/bugs &amp; to allow users to share their happy experiences :)"
MentalHealthUK,08/24/21 06:06:08,"Smoking cigarettes, lots and lots of cigarettes, constantly","It's often that I get asked how many cigarettes I smoke, you know the routine questions that GPs and nurses ask. I used to fudge the truth a bit, 'oh... 20 a day, maybe 30 if they're roll-ups'.

That's far from the truth. A more honest answer is 'constantly if the environment allows it, sometimes as much as is physically possible'. If I've had a drink or am in a highly social or stressful situation it's not unusual to have one behind each ear while rolling another while smoking one, only to realise I had one or two rolled and waiting already.

I've chewed nicotine tablets, slapped on multiple patches, tried vaping (freebase &amp; salt) at various strengths, tried the spray, the gum etc. and nothing satiates it aside from real tobacco. Even if I roll cigarettes and put them back in the pouch to re-roll later while furiously puffing upon my digital nicotine nipple the craving for real cigarettes is near constant and unquenchable.

Most of the time I don't even smoke a full one, half is enough... for now.

I've been recommended 'Champix' a few times by smoking cessation nurses, but given the experiences and emotional turmoil it's caused a couple of friends that have tried it... I don't think I would want to risk it and could easily see myself ending up back in hospital or generally flipping out (I've been doing really good, about 8 years now since the last one, and not something I want to repeat).

Yes, I sometimes have tar stained fingers, my teeth are stained, so is my tongue, my chest is wheezy, and yes I know the risks - sometimes I smoke until I feel sick, and the impact on my life expectancy is significant (in addition to the other mental health problems that also have a fair impact).

I've been doing addiction counselling for the past couple of years or so, with two different places. While it has helped curb my drinking, nobody really wants to get into the smoking problem with me as I 'have bigger things you need to address first' (hence, I'm currently pursuing ADHD and ASD assessments, keeping the drinking to a minimum, waiting on waiting lists for waiting lists, shouting into the void that is NHS mental health services to no avail).

What the fuck do I do?"
MentalHealthUK,08/24/21 03:42:00,I think I might be feeling ….. hopeful.,"Trigger warning for a brief mention of a past suicide attempt but no details of methods or anything.  


After a hypomanic bipolar high crashing into my worst ever low, I have ended up as an inpatient in a psychiatric ward.   I feel very fortunate to have received really great care so far.   I have felt listened to, with all my complex needs addressed compassionately.   I have a comfortable room, decent food and regular checks that I am safe and well.

In particular, the ambulance service that took me to A and E (after my attempted suicide) was amazing.    They reassured me that I was not wasting their time, I am not a bad person, just a person with an illness having an urgent crisis.   Like a diabetic having an emergency or a heart patient having chest pain.

One of the paramedics made me promise that next time I feel suicidal I should call my crisis line first.  If there was no answer (there wasn’t when I called on Friday) then I should call for an ambulance BEFORE I take action - and not after.   They want to help me - to help any of us - to get the help we need BEFORE we do anything drastic.  

He also said to keep hassling my GP for regular check ups, to reach out to the charities and to be kind to myself.

This guy really made a massive difference to how the rest of my hospital experience has been because I have started to adjust my perception of my illness - it needs treating, not be hidden away in shame.   


I love the NHS staff and I am so thankful for what we have.    I sincerely hope they can get more funding and appreciation.

Today I am still very low, but no longer suicidal.   

Thanks for reading xxxxxx"

My talking therapy starts tomorrow, it is after work and have work the following day. I'm feeling very apprehensive about it. Scared even. Hoping I'll be talking to the same person each time, and not sure how it will affect me after-words, when I've spoken to other people (NAPAC) I've always made a point of not having work on the day or the next day, as it drains me a great deal. My SO is away, so wont even have anyone to lean on after it. I want it, I need it but dam I don't know where to start, what to say, how it will work, if it will help. Just thinking about it is dauting right now. It's also over the phone, and I was hoping for something more face-to-face, as I know I say a great deal more in my body langue and facial expressions than I do with words or tone. I don't know, not even sure why I've typed now. Not told SO yet about it starting, don't want to bother SO off on a mini get-a-way to visiting family and friends down south. SO should be able to have a nice time, with-out worrying. But just want a huge now. Doesn't come back until the 28th, I think might stay longer and already been gone for a week.

MentalHealthUK,08/23/21 23:01:33,Anxiety over feeling sick. Is there any treatment or strategies people recommend?,"TLDR; I can't tolerate physical discomfort — feeling dizzy makes me panic, I am terrified to get my 2nd vaccine because I might feel sick after it, when I feel nauseous it's as if the world is ending. Wtf do I do?!

My panic and anxiety started when I was feeling vulnerable due to a physical problem, I felt helpless against the symptoms I was experiencing and some professionals I've spoken to believe that my body reverted to a trauma response I had as a child, which was panic and clamouring for a sense of control. It's not a phobia of vomiting, I just have a very low distress tolerance with any sort of illness symptom and it's as if I spiral and think I'm going to be traumatised by feeling sick and unable to fix it.

Every self-help book I've read or Google search I do, I can't find cases that mirror my own, only emetophobia stuff comes up. I am hypersensitive to sensations which is normal with anxiety sufferers, but I'm not a hypochondriac.

My CBT was focused on panic and I didn't spend too much time going into this, so maybe I should try CBT again? ACT? It would be a miracle if someone related or recovered from something similar so I could get some pointers wrt therapy/techniques/coping. It's gotten out of hand. I panic at the first sign of a symptom and get anticipatory anxiety over it too. I've spoken with my person centered therapist about it but other than the relief of venting I've received no actual help from that.

Any exposure I've tried such as spinning around to induce dizziness went badly. Hate to keep posting here as I know there's only so much commenters can do, but I have no idea how to tackle this and feel so alone in it"

MentalHealthUK,08/23/21 20:07:39,Should I ask for another referral?,"There’s mentions of self-harm and suicide in here- so just as a T/W. Sorry if this gets kinda dark, just in a bit of a hopeless situation atm :/

So for a little bit of exposition, I’ve had intense eating problems for the last 4 years or so. A few weeks ago, I finally went to my GP to get a psychiatry referral, which still hasn’t been processed yet (It’s the NHS so I know it could take a while, despite it getting marked as ‘urgent’- though I don’t know if that actually makes any difference in the end). I also wanted to get referred to a psychiatrist due to anxiety- to the point where I’m having mini-panic attacks multiple times throughout the day, sometimes even fully blown panic attacks just because I feel so anxious and overwhelmed by everything (not helped by my eating problems, which just makes me hate myself even more). 

It’s become bad to the point where I’m starting to contemplate… bad stuff. At my dark points, I just feel so depressed and wish that everything would just go away, permanently (idk how to euphamise it in any other way). I’ve started to self harm too, and it gets to points where I don’t even realise that it’s happening until it’s happened. 

After talking to someone, they actually said that I should be being referred to an eating disorder clinic rather than a psychiatrist? Do y’all think I should book another appointment with my GP to get referred there too? Or do you think it would slow down the whole process. I’m worried that everything will take so much longer if I wait to see the psychiatrist, only to get referred to somewhere that can treat EDs from there. I just don’t know how to cope with all of this for the next few months, especially with the stress of going back to school (going into upper sixth). 

And advice and support would be really appreciated. I’ve tried talking to someone from the GP practice, but they’ve only given me really vague, non-commital answers."

MentalHealthUK,08/23/21 03:24:45,ACT resource recommendations,"ACT resource recommendations?

Hello. I suffer from anxiety symptoms mainly. I currently see a therapist who uses CBT. 

A lot of my anxiety happens “on the go”, for example when I’m outside the house, at university, sitting with friends, shopping etc. I simply don’t have the time in these situations to get out a CBT table and start working through it.

From my previous therapist, I learned that ACT is a simple technique that provided me with quick relief when I had “on the go” anxiety. Unfortunately I forgot all the techniques he taught me. 

I haven’t got the time to read a whole ACT book (as I’m already reading a CBT one), so I was looking for a resource where I can quickly learn ACT and which also provides me with lots of techniques I can use for my “on the go” anxiety. 

Would be grateful if you could recommend any resources."
MentalHealthUK,08/22/21 20:11:17,The mental health facility in my town randomly discharged me from their care and now I dont know where to go.,"Hi, so Ive been with this facility about a year and they have been pretty bad from start to finish, when I was a teenager, I was diagnosed with anxiety about 6 years ago and since then I had noticed a lot of new symptoms like insomnia, depression to the point in which I can't function or think straight, delusions, paranoia, self harm and just before I was referred to the facility a suicide attempt. 

When I had my first appointment the Psychiatrist kept interrupting me and by the end he just said maybe I have ADHD and put me on methylphenidate, I was only on it for a week and just went nuts, I was in tears for no reason, staying up all night, I was at a shop and started having the conspiracy ideas about the employees and nearly started a fight with him, when I got home I wrote a load of reviews on the place warning them against going there etc. and I was then contacted by the owner and they begged me to take them down because they had no idea what I was talking about and it was damaging their buisness. 

I then ended up going into A&amp;E because I hadnt slept more than a couple of hours a night for about a month and my mind was just not working right, nothing made sense and was going a million miles an hour, when I was there I got some help and I was reffered back to the facility. On my next appointment they actually took me seriousley and listened, I could tell they didnt listen on the first meeting because most of the stuff I said was the same but this time they were suprised and worried, at the end they said I have Cyclophymia but it could turn into Bipolar at some point and I was put on Quetiapine. 

For the first time in years i finally felt normal and happy but then I had a follow up appointment about a month later I told them this and so they said that means I dont need to be on it anymore. Pretty much immediately after coming of it I reverted back and wasnt sleeping, feeling paranoid and feeling like people were breaking in or there were other people in the house etc. I was also self harming again, cutting my shoulders almost frantically as it was the only thing easing my thoughts. I went back again and they didnt seem to see any problems with this and so referred me to a therapist, when I was there he sounded incredibly worried and said he doesnt think im ready for therapy and needed to be reassessed. 

I had to wait a month for this to happen in which everything carried on, when I had this appointment the psychiatrist barely spoke to me for 7 minutes and just rushed me and asked irrelevant questions, I didnt have a chance to speak at all really and she basically just said I'll speak with the team and get back to you shortly. I waited 2 weeks and hadn't heard anything then randomly received a letter in the post saying I had been discharged from their care as I dont meet the criteria for help at that facility and I should be ready to take care of myself now. In the entire time I was there they basically did nothing other than diagnose me with cyclothymia and put me on medication for a month. 

I now dont know what to do because my GP just sais if you are feeling bad go to A&amp;E which just seems like an extreme reaction. The only other place local to me is a Mental health hospital which I really dont want to go to and also dont feel like I need to go to all the time, just on occasion. Since being discharged I checked the reviews and all but 2 were 1\*'s, everyone pretty much had the same story as me saying they had been randomly discharged etc. I dont really know where to go now, Im just as bad as I ever was."

I asked to be referred to Psychiatry U.K. using Right to Choose, however last time I checked PUK a few months ago there was basically no waiting time and now the next appointment date is June 2022. Would it be possible to change the referral time to another place? I think even going with the standard NHS route would be after than 11 months.
I’m not keen on paying 1k for a private ADHD assessment but I’m getting desperate so if someone has some recommendations of cheap and good places to get one, I’m also open.

Thanks!"
MentalHealthUK,08/22/21 18:26:58,Work stress induced Anxiety/Depression. Question about future employment.,"Hi all,

TL:DR - Questions at the bottom about returning to work after time off and future employment.

Pre Covid I was content, happy and had found a great work life balance and was enjoying my life.

My employer of 6 years who I was very happy with prior to Covid, abused the furlough system and over worked a small number of staff (me included) during the first lockdown of 2020. They made a decision that really, really hurt me and abused my good nature and work ethic. I could go into detail but it would be a long post, but take my work for it they completely disregarded my mental health and well being and it felt like they kicked me in the face.

I was angry and bitter for a lot of the rest of 2020. That in itself put me in a bad place. We got paid bonuses (including the people who had been furloughed for months and months) at Christmas. Sure money's nice, but in my world money doesn't mean as much to me as my well being. That passion I had for my job and for the company just faded out during those months leading to the end of the year.

Fast forward to today... 2021 has been HELL. A series of events have caused chaos within the business. A job I used to enjoy has turned into a job that I'm so unhappy with it's making me ill. Due to a variety of reasons I can't do my job properly. Again, hard to explain without going into detail but I am in a position where I feel absolute despair and I've never felt like this before in my life.

It takes a lot for me to say I'm struggling and I've always been a very emotionally resilient person, but these past 18 months have broken me down to a point where I am feeling like I never have done before. I've raised my concerns twice now with my work and openly said I'm struggling. Work was supposed to be taken off me to help me cope, but it hasn't happened. I battled on because I'm well aware others are struggling too and I didn't want to let the side down.

Then 3 weeks ago I had the worst working week of my life. I was getting stress headaches every day. I was feeling sick and anxious. My heart palpitations came back and I was sat, at my desk, crying almost all the time. I realised at that point that I needed to not care if other people were struggling too and just focus on myself and if I didn't do something I was going to become seriously ill.

I went to the Doctor and got beta blockers and got signed off for 2.5 weeks. Being away from work has helped massively. My headaches have gone, my anxiety symptoms are reduced but I've noticed this new feeling creeping in which I've never felt before and that is this emptiness of which I can't shake. Almost like, what is the point? I've applied for lots of jobs over the past few weeks and managed to get a couple of interviews which perked me up, but sadly didn't get them. I just feel so sad and unenthused for life right now. If there's anything this has done it's made me realise that I want to work in a job/career that's helping people or making a difference because I feel completely useless and just like I'm existing rather than living right now.

Anyway, I'm due back next week. The Doctor is calling me tomorrow to see how I'm feeling. My family/husband want me to have more time off as they think I need a lot more time. I feel like I need more time as well, but being signed off feels so strange to me. I know I'm going to get stressed the firs t day I'm back but I am actively looking for work elsewhere so hopefully it won't be for long but at the same time it was (and is) making me physically and mentally unwell. I just don't know what to do.

I just have a few questions if anyone can help? One thing I am concerned about is finding another job. If I get offered a job and the employer finds out I've been signed off for a lengthy period of time, can they retract their offer if I haven't told them? Am I supposed to tell them? 

Also, if I go back to work and suggest I absolutely cannot cope with the job I'm doing and the workload and asked to be potentially moved into a different team/department, are they obliged to help me and try and find alternatives or can they just outright refuse to do anything?

Thank you in advance. Just typing this out has helped me a little."

 apologise if this wrong place to be posting here just needed uk perspective.

To be brief I’ve been suffering from major depression for many years to point it’s now become crippling where I’m no longer coping whatsoever, no work, no social life/partner, just mere sitting here feeling utterly hopelessl crying on and off non stop with extreme emotions, very occasionally cutting, just struggling to get through the day, pathetic I know but that’s where I’m at. 

Well last weeks came to head and landed up ODing on vodka and medication [removed at request]and was taken to hospital who I assume has referred me to mental health team and drugs/alcohol treatment center and wasn’t very helpful tbh.

Now it’s been a week and they just decided on anti depressant which I’m really not keen on trying but will give it ago but just feel stuck on my own here I’m mention many times to my gp about these issue I’ve been experiencing and it’s all just about throwing pills at the situation which hasn’t work in past. Just feel very let down by nhs, yes I could been more proactive but majority of GP have no real understanding and what I would call Jack of all trades in the medical field 

Don’t know wat trying say but how has your experience with dealing with mental health team and anything I need know anything in particular to request.

I just don’t want be here anymore like this merely existing while mins crawls away

MentalHealthUK,08/21/21 06:54:25,"I hate hearing about ""anxiety and low mood""","""Anxiety and low mood."" 
""Anxiety and low mood.""  
""Anxiety and low mood.""

It's a weird phrase in itself but it's double weird that the NHS uses it as a synonym for 90% of mental health issues. Let's sweep depression under the carpet by calling it Low Mood and let's bundle it with anxiety to make it seem solvable. 

I called NHS 111 to report a mental health crisis of an extreme rage fit, smashing furniture and screaming obscenities at the heavens. There was no one there to physically attack but I was literally clawing at the walls like a caged beast. 
At one point I snarled ""I will rip out your heart and sh** into your soul!"" I don't know where that phrase came from or who it was to be directed at, I just said it while overwhelmed by rage. 

A full month later I get to speak to someone from the crisis team (no rush) and I'm told we'll be discussing CBT to address anxiety and low mood. 

What part of that story makes you think I've got low mood? And where did anxiety come from suddenly? That's a completely different concept that might be found in some patients with depression. But it's not me. 

I protested. I said I don't have anxiety and I find the term ""low mood"" to be insulting. Is there anything else you could offer me instead of MORE [blasted] CBT that I've already done four times?

""Well let's just try this and see what happens. CBT can be effective at treating anxiety and low mood. Let's just ignore the last four failed attempts at CBT and try CBT again."""

MentalHealthUK,08/20/21 23:10:25,Generral moaning &amp; question re: how to get a diagnosis,"\*General. 😑

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies in advance for how long this post is. And how rambly/probably nonsensical it is. Please don't be rude to me if I sound like an idiot. I just need to get stuff out. Possibly the wrong flair also (maybe vent?) but I would like support/advice, I'm just not fully sure what I'm even looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

(TLDR/ question is at the bottom).

Hi. I've made the occasional post here and on another mental health related sub in the past during some of my more overwhelming moments, but I wanted to try and put something out there in a somewhat more substantial attempt at receiving support.

Background info: I'm 19M, unemployed and recently finished a third year at college. I have had mental health related issues for a very long time and I believe a lot of my current issues originate this time in my life (around age 10).

I come from a very dysfunctional family. I have two much older (half-) siblings (a fifteen-ish year age gap), both of whom have long since moved out and started their own families. I unfortunately still live with my parents, neither of whom I get on with or at this point even speak to. My mother is a depressed alcoholic who has repeatedly attempted/threatened suicide. The two of them are emotionally (occasionally physically) abusive towards each other. They were not even together when I was growing up, but still referred to each other as if they were (it was very confusing). The only reason they currently live together is because it was a last resort after my mom and I were in danger of homelessness around 2017.

I briefly reconnected with my father last year but it did not last. He reminds me of several past negative experiences I would rather forget.

After a surprisingly quick chat with my GP, in 2018 I was prescribed sertraline for depression. This was after an extended depressive (?) episode as I was leaving senior school-- with which I underperformed on my exams and cut off every person I knew (not that I had any real strong ties with many). Sometime in 2019 I stopped renewing the prescription.

As a child, I had to go to a special school for behavioural issues (spitting on strangers) and it has been a running joke among my family to mock me for my behaviour-- my mom has always called me autistic, weird, etc. They would also make lots of comments about my body that made me constantly insecure and distressed. I repeatedly would aso them to stop, they wouldn't-- it caused (and still causes) me to become extremely upset and angry. I would often end up yelling, then my mom would yell, she would sometimes hit me, I would be upset more, I'd hate her more, she'd hate me, etc. I've become a person who is very angry and miserable on the inside. It hurts.

Despite all of this, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything.

My mental health has gotten a lot worse. I am very socially isolated, at this point with no significant contact to any family members and only one friend (who is also long distance and incapable of seeing me irl). In an attempt to 'save myself', I tried and tried to reach out to my siblings, who,like everyone else, has always seen me as weird or as some sort of 'other',  in an attempt to get some form of support. I did not get any. I have no hobbies or interests and gain little to no enjoyment from anything. I have severe issues with body image (that I've had my entire life)  that have extended into very disruptive identity issues. I no longer understand who I am. I swing wildly between mindsets. I look at myself and don't see me-- but am also very much worn down with the knowledge that that is in fact me. I don't know whether I'm good or bad, stoic or too involved, sociable or not, smart or dumb, fat or thin, ANYTHING. I feel so empty and hollow and there's a constant buzz in my brain of... something.

I have a huge preoccupation with my appearance and what I think is highly likely to be BDD (body dysmorphic), thinking about my appearance and how people perceive me for hours every day.

I have sexual issues. I think about sex a lot in that I enjoy the topic of sex-- I like reading about it, I'm fascinated by weird sex stuff on the internet, am curious about fetishes, enjoy it as a theme in media-- but I can't have it. I will never have it. It terrifies me, it makes me feel sick. The idea of anyone ever seeing my body or touching me physically scares me, it makes me spiral into a panic attack. The idea of anyone finding me attractive makes me sick-- the idea of being ugly makes me sick. I look at myself and the idea of anyone seeing me in real life makes me feel sick. I have bouts where I can't leave the house because of it-- I get dressed and cry about it for hours. I restricted calories last year to a certain amount, avoided foods that scared me and ate the same exact meal every single day), recently started eating 'normally', lost control, started what I THINK is overeating, have started working out like crazy, and now have no idea how to have a healthy relationship with food. I'm eating but I'm still always hungry. And then I eat more and I feel bad. I can't stop looking in mirrors and taking photos constantly just to see how I look. It's bad. I look bad.

I have a fear I have repressed memories that explain where my physical touching/sex/intimacy issues start. I have some concerning childhood memories that I think about often and cause me a lot of distress (a vague pre-therapy interview immediately acknowedged it as trauma and wants me to see a trauma specialist. I think there's a possibility I have C-PTSD).

I'm fatigued constantly. I talk to myself aloud constantly. My mind feels like it's running so fast I can't keep up with every thought. All I do is think about past traumas or daydream about the future, or sit there analysing myself and my behaviour. Every thought all day is about the same things. I feel like I can never live a normal or happy life because I am  just incapable of it.

I recognise that I am not normal and yearn to live a normal life, being very obsessed with this idea of normalcy and being a 'real person', because I feel as though I'm not. I don't feel as though I have appropriate reactions to things or have a normal place in society. I feel like I'm not a real person, like I'm not really grounded to real life in the way that everyone else is, and am instead hyperaware and introspective, overly analytical and calculating about every situation I am in and everyone I talk to. I don't get on with others in the way that other people do-- I don't connect well, I talk weirdly, I this, I that, etc etc.

I want to die so badly. I have some kind of prevention mechanism in my head that stops me from actually doing it so don't worry. But it's the only reasonable way out in my mind-- there's no other solution. I know I will be unhappy my entire life. Everyone says it gets better but some people, it doesn't. Even if I vaguely function in society (fat chance), I'm never going to be really, genuinely fulfilled or feel even like a normal person. It sucks.

And I want help. I want to be normal. But I've tried. And no one cares. I don't have any support system. I've signed myself up for a sort of free therapy thing on the NHS, but the 'waiting list is too long'. I'm starting to think they don't have a waiting list, they just can't find a therapist who can actually handle the long list of severely conflicting issues that I  cried down the phone at them during my little mini interview thing.

I tick off so many symptoms for so many different things. This post isn't anywhere near the range of my problems but I need to stop my crazy rambling somewhere because I'm in a clear enough headspace to at least VAGUELY express some of the things that trouble me.

(Yes, I just cried in the middle of the street a couple of hours ago. I just wish I had someone to talk to. But then again no. Because that's a whole other can of worms. Sigh.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, yeah. The question...s.

How do I even begin to go about a diagnosis when there are so many symptoms for so many different things, when I have so many different problems? Who I do even go to initially? Do you just stroll up to your GP and say ""I have severe mental health problems. All I do is cry all day and want to die. Here's a comprehensive list of every disorder google tells me I may or may not be at risk of having.""  I know diagnosis isn't the be-all end-all but I just so badly want a name to what's wrong with me, to know that there IS something wrong with me that I can at least search for, get support for that specific problem. Maybe start to build SOME semblance of even basic function. I don't even want friends or family or love. I just want to be on my own because I feel so much better on my own. A small flat, routine. Not to feel sick just by existing. That's it!

God. Sorry to whoever actually sits and reads this. Thanks for anyone who does and takes the time to write a response (no one usually does lol). I'm sorry I sound stupid and all over the place. Being coherent and succinct is hard.

Again, not sure what support I'm asking for because this is all over the place. But thanks for any given :)"

MentalHealthUK,08/20/21 21:53:16,Is not wanting to eat a form of self harm?,"TW-self harm

Hi

I have been dealing with mental health issues for a while and I am currently taking medication and under a doctor, as well as waiting to get into therapy (the pandemic has caused a bit of a backlog in my city), however I’m not at risk because I’m not self harming or thinking about the other thing that would put me in the “at risk” category so I’m fairly low on the list. 

I often don’t eat, it’s not because of a lack of appetite or due to an eating disorder, but sometimes if I’ve had a really rough day at work, I won’t eat when I get home and that the associated headaches I get from not eating are a punishment for being a fuck up. I’ve recently started not eating during my lunch break at work for the same reason. 

It’s kind of like when you misbehave as a kid and your parents send you to bed without any dinner, which happened to me a lot, I didn’t have a good childhood. Sometimes I would be sent to bed purely for being clumsy, that kind of thing, so I guess it’s a learned coping mechanism for me but a very unhealthy one. 

I usually eat once the headache gets unbearable enough to need to take painkillers, which I can’t take on an empty stomach. 

My CBT therapist (when I had one, the first round of CBT finished in November) did say she suspected I was dealing with some sort of childhood trauma but that wasn’t really something she specialised in and did acknowledge that it was a form of self harm but didn’t really give me any advice on what to do or how to break the cycle. 

It’s not a conventional form of self harm but I know it’s not a healthy habit to have. 

What can I do?"

I’ve been suffering with some health issues for the past 2-3 years (Possible fibro/me, reoccurring sciatica) which basically led me to burn out a couple of months ago. I’ve suffered with depression for as long as I remember but usually manage to keep myself on en even keel except when other factors contribute (i.e. I had a breakdown when my dad passed away several years ago).

Ive been off work 8weeks, and am due to go back next week and I really don’t know what to do. I’m not dreading going back per se, but I am worried that I’m not ready and I’ll relapse. Since I went off 8 weeks ago, physically I feel a bit better, more rested although my sciatica has flared up again in the last couple of weeks. Mentally however I’m not sure, I not suffering from as much confusion/brain fog - but I also feel about as low as I have done in a long time.

I’m trying to get in to speak to my GP to see what she thinks, but to be honest I don’t have much faith in her based in past experiences (dismissive, can’t wait to get me off the phone). I’d also like to discuss returning to my original medication (citalopram) vs what I switched to a few months back (amitriptyline), and that change might be make me feel worse before I feel better?

I’m aware that the longer I’m off the harder it will become, but similarly I want to when I’m fit and not too soon causing a relapse etc.

Does anyone have any experience or advice with this?"

MentalHealthUK,08/19/21 21:41:12,"Called crisis for help, they called social services","Hi all. I’m 26, female. I have two children who are 2 and 9 months old. I’m currently struggling a lot with cPTSD from childhood abuse, physical abuse, my oldest child’s father was sexually, financially and physically abusive. I have to see him twice a week currently and he ensures I am alone every time so he can manipulate me. My mother is narcissistic and my dad has gone conspiracy theorist crazy. He calls me once a day to tell me Covid doesn’t exist, and because I’m asthmatic I will die now I’ve been vaccinated. He is currently undergoing a crisis and travelling to another country to get away from ‘the man.’ My mum has spent my life (whilst suffering from an ED) calling me fat when I was pregnant, ignoring me for weeks, saving my name in her phone next to vomit emojis. It’s petty but that’s all the family I have. All four grandparents who were supportive have died in the last 6 years. My current partner is supportive but having to stay home to help me as I am afraid of my daughters dad. 

I called my GP, who referred me to CMHT, who referred me to a domestic abuse charity. However they are closed for the summer and it will be 6 weeks before I receive any help. I feel I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown or in the middle of one, so I called crisis to explain my stress and explain I have had some dissociative episodes wherein I just can’t remember the last two hours for example. I have managed very well up until this point, I have tried CBT, EMDR and other therapies but was told I have too much trauma for this to work. My last resort was calling crisis. She put me on hold and then came back to tell me she’d informed social services. I asked her why, because my kids are not my issue and day to day I am capable and look after them. However I said that if my oldest child’s father gets wind of this he will immediately use this to take me for full custody. He has isolated me from my friends and drained my bank account, as well as leaving me in debt. I can’t handle another stressful situation because I feel like I’m going to explode. He tried this before and cited the fact that I suffer from narcissistic victim syndrome as an incapability to  care for my children. He gave up for my benefit, but when I mentioned this the healthcare professional said it is what it is. I cannot have him showing up here, or taking her and not bringing her home as he did when she was a baby. He has been abusive to me and shook her when she was 3 months old but said it was my fault.

I am desperate and I am working my ass off so I have the money to self fund therapy but I also desperately need my mental health in check. I am with a secondary MH team with the NHS and they have offered to refer me to psychology but the waiting time is likely to be like a year or even longer and I can’t wait for that. 

So I am in a bit of limbo as private says I’m too complex and NHS is all about waiting.

The reason I impulsively spend so much in such a short period of time is because I'm scared I might kill myself at any day, I always tell my friends that I won't do it and I say that to myself too but I use alcohol and weed as a coping mechanism since CAMHS are doing fuck all and they're not the best for ""keeping control"" so I don't know what I'm capable of doing while under the Influence.

 It's a pain in the ass living this way and I don't have enough money to last me till my next payment, I'm 16, my mother ""loves"" me and won't give me money and I don't wanna ask my friends for money because then I'd have to explain myself and then they may think of me as a shitty person always in need of money...

MentalHealthUK,08/19/21 00:40:45,I’m so done with the services,"Trigger warning for this whole post, suicidal thoughts, self harm and sexual abuse mentioned. 

I’ve recently turned 17 and I’ve been shoved around services since I was 13. I got dropped by my last therapist the the middle of my CBT therapy in February who said that she can’t help me and that CAMHS would be a better place for me. Then the waiting list was 6 weeks. 

I had my assessment two days ago. At the start of the session she said that she would give me my options at the end of the session and I can choose where I wanted to go. She didn’t know what to do with me, instead taking my case to her colleges so they can decide where to put me. 

Wherever I go, the waiting list is 6-9 months long. At 17 and 9 months I have to start the transition to adult services. 

I explained that a big part of my problem is not having depart with my sexual and emotional abuse from a few years ago. I constantly distract myself from those emotions and now it’s seriously starting to effect me. I have horrible mood swings with one extreme to the other in a matter of seconds multiple times a day. Then periods where it levels out before it starts again. 

Her only suggestion to me that I’m not already doing on a regular basis, splash cold water on my face. 

I am so done. I had plans to go away to a dance uni next September. I have worked my ass off since I was 4 years old for that. I can’t go until I get my head straight. I will literally fall apart in a week. There is a real possibility I will have to get sent to adult services before I even receive any therapy. She told me adults is very medication based and not therapy. 

I feel so unbelievably let down… again. I’ve had a past history with CAMHS this is my third referral with them. I have had serious suicidal thoughts in the past and I have a history of self harm. I am extremely worried I will go back there. 

I feel so let down. What is the actual point in trying to get help anymore. In 9 months a lot can happen. I don’t know if I can go 9 months with no help, hence part of the reason I was sent back to CAMHS in the first place. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for but any words or anything is welcome."

MentalHealthUK,08/18/21 20:01:22,I got really low last night,"TW - Suicide 

If I start by explaining the general gist of my lifestyle, then you will understand why suicide is not an option for me. I am a parent to 3 disabled children/adults, 1 of which is severely disabled and will need lifelong care. So I am the main carer.  

I have been dealing with depression this time around for over a year and have recently had my medications increased. I talk to my therapist once a week because of working through my childhood trauma and she is well aware of my self-harming and suicidal thoughts, although I have always told her that there is no way I will act on them because I couldn’t put my family through that trauma.  

So, on to last night….. For some reason, when I was driving back from the supermarket a huge wave of depressive thoughts just hit me and instead of the usual reasoning of ‘I can’t kill myself as I can’t put my family through this’ it was more of a stronger urge telling me to go through with it. I even had thoughts on what I was going to write in a suicide note, who I was going to send it to etc. I even had the thought of buying the food item that I have an anaphylactic allergy to and eating it, just as an easy access way to take myself out. No mess or anything."
MentalHealthUK,08/18/21 10:56:43,I developed a mental health related app from my personal experience!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

Their beliefs have become apparent through the messages they've been sending to estranged friends and family members, so we very much believe this is a hidden manifestation of their illness. We have provided screenshots of messages to their health team but we do not believe they are taking this seriously AT ALL.  I was 3/4 of the way through writing a message to Mr 50K for confirmation, the nature of messages, screenshots; the same thing their friends have reached out offering before it occurred to me this may have unforeseen consequences. Which I still can't foresee, so I've come here asking:

MentalHealthUK,08/18/21 03:39:19,Mental health and swelling neck.,"Now I know this may seam of an odd one, however I've noticed every-time my mental health plays up (nothing diagnosed yet, due to NHS and mental health being a joke. However suspect a complex form of PTSD, along with the symptom i.e. depression, the one that is playing up at the moment) I've noticed that my neck swells too. I use to think this was just due to one of my traumas being straggled as a very young child, thus thinking it was just a psychological sensation. Pressing on the area of the neck helps me, again just thought it was some weird comfort thing. As since that even, no one apart from my-self has or is able to touch my neck (something my SO struggles to understand), as it brings back that memory. 

Any way to the point, I know we have glands in our necks and those gland are very much capable of swelling. I searched what gland it is, and it is very much in the area of the submandibular (sliver producing gland), this also explains why I end up producing more than usual amounts of sliver during these 'hard times' and tried to search if the was a connection between mental health and this gland. Couldn't find anything help-full myself. But was wondering if any-one on here would know what could be going on? And if the is any-thing I could do to aid with the swelling (preferable natural solutions, ie food types to eat. I already eat plenty of anti-inflammatory food everyday but something else might help). Or am I being silly in thinking that mental health and this gland have anything to do with one-a-nother and it's just a coincidence.  
Also even thought I'm not in a good place at them moment, no need to worry. I've learnt to live with it at this point. Just fighting off the odd physical urges, trying to stay dis-tracked, and the rest. So I'll be fine was just wondering about this neck gland thing and mental health. 

Apologies for the tangents, I do that."
MentalHealthUK,08/18/21 02:38:05,NHS Counselling or private?,"Hi :) I'm new to this page so forgive me if this has been asked 1000 times! 

So, I'm on the precipis of a mental breakdown, I work 6 days a week on minimum wage and had been planning to start my own small business in the industry I currently work (in order to eventually earn a lil more than minimum). I've got most of in place but I really don't feel ready to start yet. My family and friends have been encouraging (or in my mind somewhat pushing) me to start right now as I should just 'go for it' and mum says as I have a degree, I should be earning above minimum wage asap. 

Thus all became too much and I'm overwhelmed. I barely communicate with friends these past few weeks and the shift in my mood has been noticed both at home and at work. Anyway, enough of my silly life story, mum said I need to get counseling as I've been this way on and off for years. I'm not sure it'll help but it's worth a shot as I'm getting tired of being judged for being emotional and feeling the way I'm feeling.

My question is; should I see a GP and get help that way or does anyone know another decent private/paid route? The issue with seeing my GP is that I find it really embarrassing. I know mental health awareness is on the up but I can see myself crying or even playing it down and achieving nothing from it. Also it may take a while as I heard there's a long waiting list? Is there another avenue to go down that maybe anyone has tried? I'm not even sure what branch of counselling I'd need to go down as it's all completely new to me! Any help would be really appreciated :)

Two people might ring me to talk about group therapy but I really don't want to do it but she told me try that first. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know if I should ring back my GP and say its wasn't helpful and that I want to try something else or give it a go and wait two weeks.

MentalHealthUK,08/18/21 00:04:51,Anyone had any issues with Single Point of Access?,"Hi all, 

I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice in regards to getting assessed fully by single point of access? I've been hearing voices now for 5 months, and I'm being refused an assessment with a psychiatrist by SPA. 

Long story as short as possible.

My doc referred my case to single point of access/Spa advising that I was hearing voices and that I needed an assessment. They then responded that I didn't need assessing and I should go for counselling. I disputed this with the Dr and someone from spa contacted me out of the blue, asked me vague questions for around 5 minutes then sent my responses to a psychiatrist who built a report that said I was basically anxious. I have a copy of the report and it's all historical medical information from 15 years ago, in 2 full pages only 2 lines about the voices and there were blatant lies in how I had responded to her questions. I since found out that the person I was speaking to wasn't even a medical professional but a social worker.

I self referred to the counsellors they recommended and was assessed by them, and they said they couldn't help because I needed specialist care and potentially meds. They then contacted spa requesting that I be properly assessed. Spa refused.

I spoke with my Dr again, who was shocked that I had yet to actually see a psychiatrist so she said she would contact spa in writing requesting a full assessment for me. Again... spa refused.

So basically I am at a standstill... no one will help and I'm basically living in a nightmare. I wont go into what the voices say or the things that I see, but suffice to say I can't live a normal life.

Has anyone else had any issues with spa, or managed to work out a way to get past brick walls like this?

Any help at all would be really appreciated"

MentalHealthUK,08/17/21 04:38:48,"NHS Psychiatrist, such a let down!","I won’t get into how bad the quality of psychiatrists are in most NHS community mental health teams, not their reluctance to prescribe better medications than the ‘standard’ ones off a hymn sheet.
This is more a post about being severely being let down. I requested an urgent appointment 4 weeks ago as my mental health had deteriorated, and the best they could do was for tomorrow. I then called them today to confirm and the Psychiatrist has cancelled! 

The reason given - as I am being handed over to a different psychiatrist (after the previous one became reluctant to prescribe anything), the new psychiatrist and the old one haven’t had a chance to discuss my medical history over the past 4 weeks due to both being on annual leave at different points. I find it ridiculous that they’ve not been able to have any form of communication these past 4 weeks. 

So I’m left with having to wait for the old psychiatrist to get back on Wednesday, for them to have a discussion, and not knowing when I’ll be seen. 

Urgh…so frustrating!"
MentalHealthUK,08/17/21 00:55:15,Any advice for getting back into a healthy sleep routine?,"As the title suggests: 

Hi friends! 27F. I’ve been signed off work for the last six weeks due to my medication (100mg sertraline) deciding it didn’t want to work anymore. I was diagnosed with mixed depression and anxiety at 19 and have been on medication since them, with semi-regular CBT interspersed throughout, so I’m pretty used to the black dog. 

During the last 6 weeks however, I’ve massively slipped out of my usual sleep pattern, something I’ve never experienced before. I used to go to bed at around midnight and wake at about 7am (a little on the light side anyway but not too bad). Now, without the pressure of work, I’m lucky if I close my eyes before 6am and will sleep through until about 5pm. 

I’ve been trying to restore my sleep hygiene but nothing has been working. And I’m due to go back to work this Saturday at 10am. I’m dreading the thought of going back to work as it is, but at this rate I’ll be doing so with about 3 hours sleep. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can snap my body back to normal in such a short period of time? Anything that’s worked for you personally? Happy to consider anything at this point, even if it may seem a bit drastic. Thanks!"

many of the application processes are also like formal job interviews as they ask for that, which triggers my workplace anxiety

all of this makes it impossible for me to process anything and thus i have to step away from the listings. this is so overwhelming and i need this broken down.

Plus people asking me if i'm volunteering as is just adding to anxiety because i'm not and feel like i should be or i'm wasting my life. i think a crush ghosted me in part because of this (and as i don't have full closure from that, it still haunts me)&gt;

i'm also terrified of middle aged men entering my personal space without my express permission and my cPTSD being triggered by them. i've tried to attend events and had to leave just before arriving because i get triggered by this even when nasty stuff dosen't happen.

Please don't send me links unless it specifically address my questions. i get overwhelmed reading lots of text on triggering topics so it'd be about as helpful as sending me links to foreign websites.

thanks"
MentalHealthUK,08/13/21 09:32:08,Hospital MH Team,"Tw: suicide attempts, overdose 

I’m in hospital again following an overdose and I’ll be meeting the hospital’s mental health team at some point tomorrow, who will decide when I should be discharged. I really don’t think it is safe for me to be going homel. What can I expect them to do if I tell them that? My first meeting with CMHT is already arranged for Monday so I don’t expect they’ll change that. 

Since my last attempt a week ago, I haven’t stopped thinking about how I could do it again, I’m thinking it now while I’ve not finished treatment for the physical effects of this week’s attempt. I’ve been really dissociated almost constantly for the last week, I don’t feel like I’m a real human being anymore and I just want everything to stop."
MentalHealthUK,08/13/21 08:38:32,I've posted this in like 5 different subreddits at this point lmao,"Trigger warnings: suicidal ideation, mentions of sexual assault and disordered eating.


Got my a level results in - I've always been a good student and was set for Bs at the lowest but started taking a medication that gave me the worst possible reaction in my last two months of college. I was told by a teacher I'd probably get my target grades at worst if I couldn't do the final exams or finish off what remained of my coursework and that was a fucking lie. Although I'm not prone to panic attacks (I got them when I was a little kid and my teachers told me off about them so I guess I just learned not to?) I had one that lasted for over an hour and a half yesterday after seeing I got three Cs. Almost ended up in hospital with the two people I live with panicking so much.

I'm going to appeal the grades but I also don't want to have to sit and explain having a mental breakdown to my teachers and I know I probably won't even change anything. I'll admit I fucked up the second year of one of the courses and was expecting a bad grade, but I was always doing okay in the other two. If there's one thing school and academia taught me, it's that my only worth is in my grades; I don't feel like I have anything else, so I'm asking myself if there's any point in living. These qualifications are with me for life now, every time I apply for a job or volunteering people will see how much I fucked up and I will see how much I fucked up and I can't take it. Seeing how panicked my family were the other day, I feel like a dead weight, I feel like nothing and I want to fucking die. I just don't want to attempt for my family. I can't put them through that.

I also know how much I need help but I can only get one appointment every two weeks and it's not enough. I know medication can help but after that bad reaction I'm waiting on a 2nd opinion on a recommended one and it's taking ages.

It just feels like I went through so much for nothing. Going to college was so hard for me, I was living on my own with my mum, who had undiagnosed untreated depression and anxiety for the first year and was in college as well. Never in my life did I understand that it was not normal to not want to get out of bed pretty much every day, I get paranoid at night and can't sleep for most of it but would still get up and go. I was fighting an eating disorder while my friends were joking I had one, I lost my best friend this year because I realised he sexually assaulted me when I was 16, I also realised this has happened to me from other people. Because my mum was in college I would get the bus home and just collapse onto the sofa and sleep. A guy that tried to get me drunk (and possibly spiked me) at the only party I'd ever been to got on the bus along with all of his friends and I just had to accept that he knew what area I lived in after that. There was so much more but in a nutshell I was so so alone and struggling so much. I wanted help but the college I go to didnt even have a counsellor, this January was the first time I was ever referred to anyone for psychological help and it took months of waiting to even get there because it was just after I turned 18. My first counsellor also wasn't a good fit for me and several calls ended with my feeling worse after them.

I tried so fucking hard and I just feel like I wasted two years of my life. Not to mention watched everyone else have fun while it happened. I should have been able to get help as a child and I should have just been able to be a teenager.

TLDR: My A Level results are pushing me over the edge and now I feel suicidal. 🥳"
MentalHealthUK,08/13/21 05:48:10,Concerns over discretionary sickpay prior to taking long term sick period,"I've worked incredibly hard at my current job. I previously had severe mental health issues causing substance issues. The fallout from that, not substance misuse itself, took a toll on my sick record. I almost got sacked and cleaned my act up. Worked incredibly hard. I now have one of the best sickness records in the office.

2 instances in 18months. 5 days total. My boss threatened sick pay was discretionary and may not pay me for a bowel problem (stress related) because he didn't feel I was taking it seriously. This was after drastic diet changes, an MRI, endoscopy, colonoscopy and 2 consultants looking into it.

I'm considering going on long term sick. I can't take it anymore. I need some time for me. Thoughts of relapse are creeping up. I'm beginning to think about suicide again. I sleep for 4-5hrs a night and have done for months. I have nightmare when I sleep and wake up regularly. I work out a lot and it helps but this job feels like it's taking away my soul. I feel like someone people can talk to like a piece of dirt. I do more work, I get paid no less. I really struggle to get by for a high stress job where I don't feel like a human being.

I've not been this depressed for years and I'm worried about how this can spiral when it can lead - suicide. I've been there many times before.

I'm well within company sickness guidelines. I've been there for 5 years - they will pay up to 20 weeks sick pay at full pay. I'm worried my boss will turn around and refuse to pay me this. Other people have been paid for months of sick for joint and back problems. There has never been long term sick pay refusal but the new boss is different. I can't trust him.

What can I do against this if this decision is made? Do I have anyone on my side that can help? I'm not in a union. 

I don't want to keep heading down the dark road I'm going down because i know where it leads. I need my pay cheque to keep going to the gym, eating healthy, manage debts and really, spend money on getting better. I feel they owe this to me if I'm ill - that was the agreement and the job has caused this. I've done nothing but exercise, meditate, be engaged in my pass times and tried to stay healthy.

I've done my bit and I want them to do theirs."
MentalHealthUK,08/13/21 04:24:03,Hello everyone. My name is Shay Rhayader and I am a South Afican author and poet. I am currently working on a collection of hundreds of short stories and poems from different people all around the world that I want to put together into a book dedicated towards celebrating what it means to be human!,"
Hello 

My name is Shay Rhayader. I am a self-published author and poet. But more importantly, I am a just a tiny piece of carbon that shares a planet with another 7.7 billion home sapiens. And although we may come from different walks of life, different shapes and sizes, different colours and tongues, different ages and ideas, we all have one commonality. We all have an unique individual experience of what it means to be alive as a member of the human race. A story of our own that reflects a small part of our entire existence. 

The sheer size of that number has always overwhelmed me. 7.7 billion different experiences. Imagine the amount of stories humanity must hold with that many people. The number is uncountable. Imagine how many will be forgotten, or worse, how many will never be told at all. The rest of the world would never know them. Never laugh or cry at them. Never learn from them or be inspired by them. Because we will can never know what our stories might mean to another human being somewhere on our planet. 

And so I have started working on my new book. A celebration of humanity. Hundreds of short stories from all around the world that aim to capture what it means to be human and to be alive. These stories could be about anything.  Anything that forms a part of your existence and experience of life. Whether it be a poem, a descriptive piece, a story of future dreams or a retelling of past memories, it doesn't matter. There is no limit on what it means to be human. It does not need to have a deeper meaning or a specific point. It does not need to have characters or a plotline. It does not even need to be real. It can be a complete creation of imagination. 

Whatever story you wish to tell, I want to hear it. And you will probably find that there are others put there who need to hear it. 

If you are keen to share your story with the world or are interested in learning more, please let know and I can send my e mail address to you! You may of course choose to give me your name and tell me everything you want me to include about yourself or you can remain anonymous. Just another human being telling the world a story perhaps :) 

Have a wonderful life my fellow humans and remember to keep discovering all the meaning and magic of your existence. 

To finish off, I would like to quote the brilliant English writer, Alan Bennett, who I believe summaries everything I am trying to achieve by making this book. 

“The best moments in reading are when you come across something – a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things – that you'd thought special, particular to you. And here it is, set down by someone else, a person you've never met, maybe even someone long dead. It's as if a hand has come out, and taken yours..."""
MentalHealthUK,08/13/21 01:48:12,Friend was murdered by the paramilitary over 2 years ago and I still have no psychotherapy help despite asking over and over. I'm deeply traumatised and seeing my doctor tomorrow. Any advice to get her to take my MH seriously?,"In 2019 I lost two friends within three weeks. One was Lyra McKee, the young journalist murdered by the new IRA a couple years back. I'm an immigrant to the UK and she was one of the first people I befriended here. Her death was traumatic and widely covered in the media so I couldn't escape seeing her and our mutual friends splashed across the newspapers.

It completely changed the way I see this country. I'm depressed, traumatised and afraid that the lack of treatment may be leaving me with permanent damage. I've been on antidepressants for a while now which have just recently stopped the constant suicidal thoughts. haven't been able to work in months -- it's affected my family too. My husband is on anti-anxiety medication for the first time in his life largely due to the fallout of my depression. I'm seeing my doctor for an unrelated issue tomorrow. If anyone has any advice on how to communicate how much I'm suffering, I would appreciate it."
MentalHealthUK,08/12/21 23:39:28,[Vent] It's been a horrible month and we're not even two weeks in.,"It's been a horrible ass month. My nephew died (stillbirth) last week, the funeral is next week and we're short on funds. I've sold a laptop, Xbox Games, and every other possession (Aside from my phone and work computer) to be even remotely close, and we're £150 short. Each time we think we're getting close, a new cost is added. 

Today's was the function room, £200 in total but they're deferring half by a week so we can scrounge it together. That has to be paid cash to the owners, so it's not like we can set up a GoFundMe or anything.

I've posted to my main socials: here, Tumblr and Twitter. I tried r/assistance and mods asked me not to post until Feb 2022 due to previous requests. Tumblr has had a fair few reblogs and Twitter has had very little interaction. 

We/My sister has used the government assistance to get to where we are now, but we're so close that it feels horrible to not be able to get that last bit and give him the send-off he deserves.

My mental health was already shot but now it's so much worse. A few people have donated but as mentioned earlier, it just keeps getting higher and higher and I don't think I can get any more out.  

Please send me some love"

MentalHealthUK,08/11/21 23:13:10,How much more?,"Everything in my life is just hideous right now.  My father died in April ,I have another relative who is dying of cancer and I have no Family  no Friends  No job and no prospect of one. I am completely alone with this . 

Last year was awful but this year has just gotten worse . I see absolutely no way out of this except of going for the exit myself. Its strange in a very twisted way I think its a good thing if things had not got this bad I would never have seriously done anything but circumstances are making me and maybe that is not a bad thing."
MentalHealthUK,08/11/21 20:48:02,How much of today's mental health issues could be the result of an existential crisis?,"I'm just wondering. Because since we have largely secularised much of the West. I've seen people who look empty inside. 

Much of what gave life meaning was religion and as stated above we have largely abandoned those ideas. I'm not saying people can't have an existential crisis and be religious. But religion does make it easier to State that life has meaning when you believe that a diety is ""batting for you"".  

There is even a new york times wrote an op ed piece about this. 
""Opinion | Suicides Have Increased. Is This an Existential Crisis? - The New York Times"" https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/opinion/sunday/suicide-rate-existential-crisis.html

I'm just asking and wondering"
MentalHealthUK,08/11/21 20:39:18,I'm so sick of how some parts of the NHS talk to me. Am I alone in this?,"I feel like I come away from every interaction either in tears or seethingly angry. I've been trying to book a blood test for months for an extremely important health appointment in December that is now rapidly approaching. I've easily called 20 times, if not more. Each time I get ignored, told I have to call back another time, or told they can't book me. Today I finally got through and seconds away from booking my appointment they hang up on me. I call back again, get to the operator, apologise profusely for calling again and ask to be directed to the blood clinic again.

What does he do? He yells down the phone, 'PLEASE?' 

I have a raging headache from being miserable, not sleeping, not eating, stress, everything induced from the fact I'm unmedicated and haven't been able to see my GP since the last December before COVID. Maybe I didn't specifically say please, but I sure as hell said, 'hello! i'm so sorry for calling again, it seems there was an error that hung up the line, im really sorry, could you direct me to the blood clinic again?'

But I guess that wasn't polite enough so he had to yell down the phone at me. After several seconds of silence I just go 'please?' only for him to snort and go 'yeah, okay' before transferring me.

Oh, and the blood clinic hung up on me again. And now I'm too upset to call back because if I get that operator again I'll probably burst into tears and he'll yell at me again.

I'm so sick of it. I've been unmedicated for over a year because I can't see my GP because there's no appointments, not even over the phone and email, it's all about covid, covid, covid. I have severe BPD on top of so many other things and I'm reaching my breaking point. I'll make peace with having no meds, no doctor to talk to, no support, constant chronic pain, a suspected cyst, but I want this blood test. I want this simple blood test I've tried months to get.

But I guess I'll never get it. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like giving up and letting myself rot and die because it's impossible to get any help anymore.

Sorry for the miserable vent. Today is a bad day and this phone call incident has been the nail in the coffin. I'll have to pay a friend to call them up for me because I can't do it again."
MentalHealthUK,08/11/21 19:28:36,Thoughts on italk?,"I've been dealing with the usual mental health issues of anxiety and depression for a while now and I'm also on the autistic spectrum. 

In the Hampshire area the only free therapy a GP will offer you is iTalk and then it's a months long wait. Despite all the waiting I've tried most of their services; Silver Cloud, CBT (which helped a little for the short term but I could have done with more sessions for which they only offered around 6 or 7). Then when CBT didn't seem to work enough I was referred to counselling for depression instead. It was another 3 months or longer wait and I find general counselling isn't helping me that much either. In fact I'm finding it less effective and more stressful than CBT.

Is therapy/counselling just not for me? Is it something to do with being on the spectrum and those difficulties that causes counselling not to work for me as effectively? 

I started taking medication back in March and I've found that's the only thing that's given me a noticeable change but I still don't always feel 100%

I'm curious to know how other people feel about iTalk and how effective it was in helping them because I think I'm going to quit it but I still haven't fully decided."
MentalHealthUK,08/11/21 09:48:12,Immeadiate support,"TW for suicide and self harm


The past few weeks have been absolute hell.

I've been in and out of CAMHS, Y.E.S, Time Too Talk (when it was still around) for 6-7 years now (I am 17) and have been diagnosed with moderate depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and ASD for 4 years. 

Essentially, what I am assuming is a severe depressive episode turned my world upside down and I am experiencing one of the worst mental health spirals I have ever had. I have had a continuous self harming problem since I was 11, over the past 2 weeks it has gone from once a week too every day in increasing severity. I was hospitalized twice since last Friday due too a suicide attempt, and then again this Monday. Both times I was assessed, had an x-ray done too locate the foreign object, and then sent home. CAMHS was alerted too my condition and I was given a crisis number too call when my mental state was unbearable, and when I tried ringing today, it turns out I'm not on their crisis books.

Every day is melting together, it's like I'm in a constant state of dreaming. I can't remeber anything and from the moment I wake up it's like I can't cope. Never before have I been this suicidal. It's like I've lost the mental barrier that used too stop me. My parents have always regulated anything with a blade in our house but I always manage too get my hands on something and do some severe damage, and I am absolutely terrified of this fact. I'm terrified of myself, I dont feel safe around myself or in my own home BECAUSE of the chance I find something. I find myself waking up and immeadiatly deciding that tonight I will try again subconsciously. And then I do it because it has lost the scare factor it used too have, it's like I've gotten too the point where I just don't care anymore. I'm terrified.

I feel so alone, I know I'm not but I'm so tired and overwhelmed by having too wake up and deal with the nausea and the hopelessness and all these disgusting miserable painful feelings. Nothing feels real, all I have the energy too do is cry, sleep. I can't even eat properly, my appetite has depleted and I'm sleeping on average 15 hours a day. I know it's unhealthy but I've given up. I thought I was on the up but I'm not, I don't want too be here anymore. 

I don't feel safe in my own home, I don't feel safe around myself. I know the minute I get ahold of something I'll just end up at square one. The constant self harm and suicidal urges is getting too much and I just want it too stop, I want help, I want too be somewhere where I am safe and I have support. My parents are both lost on what too do and my mum is distraught, I can't keep hurting them like this, I don't want too keep hurting myself like this but I can't stop.

Does anyone know how too get immediate help, CAMHS is going too put me on a waiting list for god knows how long and I can't keep doing this for that long. I'm desperate, I can't afford my own private therapy because I don't get payed until the end of the month, and I don't expect/want my parents too pay because in the area I live it's ridiculously expensive. I am shit scared of what is happening because I don't understand it, I don't want too feel like this anymore I just want too be happy again. Even if I'm not happy I just want too feel safe.

Today was terrifying. Mondays attempt led too having my room searched and anything I could harm myself with being confiscated (fair enough). All the medicine has been removed from the cupboards and my parents bedroom door has a lock on it now. The moment I woke up from a nap I was flooded with the urges and since I had no way of dealing with them, I rang childline.

Too sum it up, the lady on the other end of the phone told me she wanted too get me help immeadiatly and wanted too call the police so they could take me too the hospital. It clicked that this way there was a chance I could be seen immediately or possibly sectioned due too the fact I am a danger too myself. I was all for it but my parents were not. I was already mid meltdown when this all kicked off and my parents let me cry/scream/shout it out while my dad rang CAMHS and explained that his child was having an episode and he didn't know what too do. I begged my parents too let me say yes, the help was right there for the taking but my parents did not want it that way. I don't understand why they said no but I'm sure there was a reason. They were prepping too drive me back up too A&amp;E but in the end we just ended up driving around buckinghamshire until I wore myself out. 

Is there anyway I can get immediate help, is it even possible. And in the worse case scenario what is the criteria for being sectioned. I'm at the end of my rope, this has become an everyday problem and I can't cope anymore."

MentalHealthUK,08/11/21 05:18:45,How have you explained gaps in your work when interviewing for jobs?,"I was basically forced to resign from my last job because my depression was making my performance poor and they weren't going to keep me on after my 6 month probation. Pretty fucked up situation there but I didn't want to stay anyway. 

I left the previous job after 6 months too because I hated the hours and it wasn't a good fit in general. 

I have a little bit of an emergency fund that means finding a job ASAP isn't critical, but I've been out of work for a month now and I'm applying for part time jobs. I had one interview last week and they asked if the jobs were temp jobs and what I was doing now, for which I gave a brush off answer about personal circumstances, but I don't think I sold it very well. 

I basically just want a part time job stacking shelves and shit but I don't know if I'm going to even manage that.

MentalHealthUK,08/11/21 05:10:17,Am I suffering from a mental illness or am I just exaggerating?,"I am 14 (F).

It’s not good of me to be thinking that I have a mental illness when there are people out there who are really suffering. Teachers at school became concerned about me and I am now talking to the school nurse. I can’t remember a lot of what happened in our first meeting, my memory is terrible. I think she told me that I am showing symptoms of anxiety and depression. She asked me if I am suicidal. I said no. I am now but I can’t bare the thought of hurting myself. It just seems really selfish. I won’t do it.

Here is an insight on what I’m like in school: I am a quiet person, I find it really hard to keep conversations going, I’m in the classes with all the clever kids but I don’t consider myself that smart. I get really anxious when waiting for my friends to get food because I’m usually the first one at the table. It feels like everyone is looking at me. I also have a hard time maintaining eye contact.

I have an eating problem as well. I eat something about 2 hours before I sleep, I wake up for school and I don’t eat anything until I come home from school. I basically starve myself for about 16 hours. Five days a week.

I don’t know how long I’ve had these suspected symptoms of anxiety and depression but they really showed up when I had my end of year exams. I had my final exam. Physics. I come into school thinking that this feeling of wanting to be sick will go away but it doesn’t so I end up getting sent home and I do my catch up exam on Monday. The day I had that catch up exam, I was sick twice and literally fell asleep during it… I didn’t come in for the rest of the week and that’s when my dad addressed the school about my eating problem. The week after that I come into school but I was late the whole week because the feeling of being sick would not go away. Fast forward to the last day of school. I was about to leave the house and I was sick. I was fine after.

Now onto my current problems. I was dreading the summer holidays. I have four weeks left, three weeks have gone. I have a chemistry test to be revising for and I can’t do it. I’ve started it but it’s so hard to finish and I keeps on getting distracted with YouTube or I end up browsing Reddit. I keeps on saying that I’ll do it tomorrow but I don’t and it repeats.

I'm constantly talking to myself inside my head and making up scenarios which end with me crying sometimes. I know the talking is normal, everyone does that but is the crying?

Sometimes I don't know how I'm feeling emotionally. I don't know if I am happy or sad. There are days where I feel like anything is possible and days where I feel like rubbish. I get random bursts of confidence as well which makes me do stupid things that gets me into trouble at school. About a week I ago I had this feeling of happiness and I was literally bouncing off the walls. It lasted about an hour. I was laughing, making weird noises, pacing, tapping my feet and annoying my family. This happened at school as well but only involved me laughing and talking a lot more which is weird because I rarely do that.

I sit in my room all day behind a closed door and only come out when necessary. I don't enjoy playing the PlayStation anymore which is something I love doing.

I recently watched a movie called girl interrupted and I don't know why I could relate to it so well. It is really good movie though.

Since the breakup up of school in May I've just been in he house being a complete lonely bum (don't talk to anybody apart from family).

The uncertainty is really scaring me and I can't do anything about it, can't make a decision. I get really on edge and just full chaos in my head. I feel like if I can't accomplish anything, make a decision, I may as well not be alive.

MentalHealthUK,08/10/21 03:22:15,Dealing with imposter syndrome,"Hi guys

I posted a few months ago after having a breakdown at work due to some performance issues I had been having and I got a lot of helpful advice so I hope you guys can help me again. 

I’m having difficulty expressing how I feel without coming across as crazy, I will try to do so here. 

I was signed off for 3 months on doctors advice and was given medication (anti depressants) for my anxiety and meds to help with my insomnia. There is still a long waiting list to refer myself back to CBT, however it was not very helpful the last time I went through it. 

I have returned to work now but I’m fighting with myself every morning between going to work and not bothering. Obviously I want to be there. I have worked there for 7 years and I know I can do it but I’m dealing big time with imposter syndrome. I don’t feel like I belong there, I feel like I don’t deserve to be there and I can’t do the job, so why should I bother? 

Work have been supportive, when I returned they put me on a structured workload and have gradually got me back into doing tasks under supervision but the second something goes wrong or my colleagues ask me questions about how to fix things to complete the task, my brain just empties. I know what needs to be done and how to respond to the question but it’s like i can’t do it. It feels like I’m playing a video game and the buttons on my control pad have stopped working. I then get this voice in my head that tells me I’m a fuck up and that stops me from doing anything. I feel like I’m an entirely different person and I’ve stolen somebody else’s job or that I’ve somehow made it this far at work purely by coincidence or a fluke. I explained this to my husband who says it sounds like I’m having a disassociative episode (I have probably spelt that incorrectly) but it feels like this all the time. 

Today after one of these episodes, I had a huge panic attack and started scratching at my neck to break out of it, something I wasn’t aware of doing at all until a colleague noticed I had scratch marks there. 

I really can’t take any more time off as they have already implied that there is a question mark over my absences this year and I truly do want to be there but i’m worried if I tell them how I really feel or I tell my doctor, that I’ll be sectioned and I don’t really know what else to do."
MentalHealthUK,08/10/21 02:32:14,I don't know what to do,"I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder last month, 10 days later, my Grandma who I was close with passed away, I've worked every single shift I was scheduled to work, no time off for either but I'm at absolute breaking point. I need time off but I don't get any financial support and can't afford the time off, on top of this I'm having awful fibromyalgia pain flare ups and running on 3 to 4 hours sleep a night. 

Any suggestions? My workplace have been good but there's nothing more they can really do for me"
MentalHealthUK,08/09/21 21:53:50,"After psychotic depression, my Mum doesn’t believe anything anyone says to her anymore","Hi everyone. I'm writing here because I have no where else to turn and would really appreciate any advise anyone has.

My Mum has been in and out of mental health facilities under section over the past two years. This was a result of her long term partner leaving her. I understand from Mum’s past that she has always been with someone and the few relationships she’s had have all been long term. She couldn’t cope alone, stopped eating and became psychotic.

She was diagnosed with a psychotic depression and has been taking medication since. She also had a lot of ECT sessions.

Her current medication:

* Two 10mg Aripiprazole tablets each morning
* 500mcg Lorazepam, one morning one night
* 15mg Mirtazapine one at night
* 150mg Venlafaxine two in the morning

She has now been out of hospital for 6 months and is doing much better. However, there is one massive difference to her character: she doesn’t believe anything anyone says to her.

I spent the afternoon with her yesterday with her sister (my aunt). We were chatting away the whole afternoon about general things and Mum was shaking her head the whole time. We confronted it several times, and Mum would say “that’s rubbish” or she’d laugh and say “stop making it up”. When I got home, she sent me a long text how she wished everyone would stop making up all these stories like she was stupid.

She doesn’t know what to believe and what not to believe. This has been the same for the past few months and it’s not getting any better.

Does anyone know what might be causing this? Mum doesn’t have insight, she says she’s fine and not ill, so I can’t get her in front of the right people to talk about it."

I feel like I’m putting my life on hold until I get treatment. Do you have any suggestions which may help both day to day activities/work and long term plans? Thank you! 



I recently had been referred for an adhd assessment and they have accepted both the statements from myself and my GP (primary care doctor), so I'm on the waiting list! (Woo!)

The not-so-woo(!) part is that they have sent a letter saying before covid the waiting list was about 12 months but now they don't have an estimate of how long it may take. The thing is now I'm kind of just living with this possible condition but have no advice or help and feel like I'm putting things on hold until I have this assessment/diagnosis/treatment. 

I want to do a masters degree, but I'm putting it off as I had a hard time focusing and managing myself during my bachelor's degree. But because of this it feels like I'm kind of just lost in doing nothing and not what I want. But I also want to be able to do a masters as prepared as possible and with all the resources to help me.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to make myself feel better and not feel stalled whilst waiting for my assessment? I feel like I struggle a lot day but day but also at the prospects of my future. Thank you :)"

- Being extremely disassociated with intermittent feelings of despair when able to feel emotion
- Being engaged but not wanting to get married or be in a relationship 
- Wanting financial independence but being financially dependent on my partner
- Being too worried to leave my partner due to his mental health difficulties
- Struggling with intense feelings of guilt due the above and having pets together
- Struggling with a deficit in verbal communication (possibly autism) which makes it hard to get support
- Not understanding my feelings from past sexual abuse which I thought didn't bother me but it has randomly started impacting me a decade later
- Unable to get a job or complete education without support due to mental health issues and verbal communication difficulties
- Not being able to get a diagnosis for autism due to relocating often because of my partner's career
- Not having my own housekeys and being too anxious to ask my partner because he will question me about this and I don't have an answer 
- Not having privacy aside from in the bathroom which is the only place I can let myself cry
- Having no support network such as friends or family 

I really need help as I can't live the rest of my life like this. Last time I was bad I had help from my university and the crisis team, but this time I don't have anyone to turn to.

MentalHealthUK,08/08/21 06:05:17,I was back in A&amp;E on Thursday night,"Tw: suicide, overdose 

I’m on seven day prescriptions for my medication and on Thursday night I decided it would be a good idea to take it all in one go. I really didn’t think I had enough to do any serious damage to me, though I hoped it would. I phoned the crisis team who told me they had to call an ambulance. 

I was discharged this afternoon and I’m physically fine. I’m covered in bruises because I had a seizure while I was waiting on a bed in A&amp;E and fell off it. Everything hurts. I stopped breathing for a minute. If I hadn’t phoned the crisis team there’s a good chance I’d have been dead by now. 

It’s been three weeks since I was last in there because of an overdose, and that experience was awful. This time was much better. Everyone was wonderful. The paramedic showed me photos of his dog. I woke up after the seizure in a little room in the ED and had some lovely people around me for a few hours before I was moved onto the ward. I wish I remembered all their names. 

I really hope I get some proper support this time. The hospital MH team are going to change the referral to CMHT the crisis team did because they think I need more support than I was referred for, and are going to try to put something in place during any waiting period for this. 

I’m not really sure what the point of this post is. I just wanted to say it all to someone who won’t judge me, or panic like my partner is doing  😅"

So I am 22 years old and female. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD when I was 18. In the space of a year I seen my friend get killed, found my dad dead and my little cousin passed away. 

Since then I’ve been homeless, struggled with my mental health, my relationship, University, impulsive behaviours etc. I am on 150mg Sertraline, done CBT, talking therapy and EMDR. 

Past year I have been in and out of hospital constantly due to gynochological issues, which has effected my life, work life and University very much. I have had 3 admissions in 2 months. I also just recently lost my nana, however I wasn’t very close to her. 

I have always been quite positive and resilient, never give up and always try but for the past two weeks I just feel like numb and empty, like everything is pointless, nothing is making me happy, I’m constantly exhausted, but bored at the same time. And even though mental health is something I have always struggled with, this time it seems different. I feel like I have lost my spark. Just like miserable, like I’m on auto pilot and the things I used to do to help me like exercise, self care etc, isn’t working. Just not sure whats going on or what to do"

I've seen many different psychiatrists since I was at CAMHS and now at the CMHT. It's next Thursday the appointment is. I have no idea what we're going to discuss other than medication. I don't think they really care about my symptoms I have regarding my mental health. I think they're reluctant to give me another diagnosis because that would mean more treatment I'd require.

On the bright side of it, I got a call of the psychologist this Thursday, and he said he's going to put my treatment forward for November. It's funny because I was told the waiting list was a year, but apparently it's 18-months. Nevertheless, he's put it forward and I should be seeing the psychologist in November time! He said due to the nature of my mental health being complex. Him and his team are going to see me sooner rather than later.

But about the psychiatrist, I have no idea what I'm going to be saying to the psychiatrist. I'm going to type up some information about me. Other than that I don't really know what to tell them. This is the 4th different psychiatrist I'm going to be seeing at the CMHT."

- I achieved 4A*s with those CDG'S from school
- black belt in martial arts

I don't do martial arts anymore, my skills are rotting away I'm not actually good at my subjects, I don't talk to anyone, I personally think no one can truly understand me.

All my peers are off to uni, I'm stuck at home, hopefully for another year before I reapply for uni. I'm not optimistic at all. I hate interviews, flopped all 4 I had before because I was too scared and anxious to prepare. I just feel like my life is slipping away and I'll become nobody, useless and pointless.

I've been to a couple of therapy sessions but was let go of, I really can't implement any of those self help things, they just don't work, all those thoughts just come back.

To be honest, I really struggle to find the motivation to be alive and to just be a functioning citizen of society.

MentalHealthUK,08/07/21 05:41:33,My issues have led to me developing an addiction to porn/adult content. Anywhere that helps in dealing with such an addiction?,"Since the start of Covid and the Lockdowns that we found ourselves in, I think because of feeling lonely and isolated, having nothing happening in my dating life no matter what I try, being ignored by people and boredom. I've developed an addiction to adult content/porn. I've always struggled with managing finances. But I feel in recent months with this added addiction things are even worse when it comes to managing my money. Now we are out of lockdown and the rules are mostly relaxed there have been two occasions I've gone into and spent alot of money in lap dancing clubs aswell. I realise this has to stop and it's an addiction I must get out of. But I'm not sure where to begin or who to turn to that can help with such an addiction.

in march of 2020, i was taken to a&amp;e after an attempt on my life. i spent the night in hospital and due to the nature of the attempt, i was deemed physically well to go home. after an extremely quick meeting with a camhs worker in hospital she also decided i was fit to leave. i was far from it. i attempted again later that day.

the week after that, i was discharged by my camhs therapist and psychiatrist and left with a 150mg prescription of sertraline to essentially fend for myself. they had decided that, after 6 months of treatment, that i wasn’t going to get better and discharging me would be the best option.  

it’s been a year and a half since that attempt. i’ve had several more since then. several more trips to a&amp;e, many run ins with the police and crisis mental health workers. each telling me that i’m in the priority list for camhs and that i’ll get help within a month. nothing has ever come from those claims.

MentalHealthUK,08/07/21 01:44:43,Experience getting refunded from hospitals taking possessions?,"Hi,
I was an inpatient in a hospital in NHS Lothian in late May, and unbeknown to me they took headphones worth ~£40 and a belt from the 90's (was shockingly still going strong) that I could guesstimate at around £30. These weren't given back to me on discharge, and it was only later when I couldn't find them at home that I realised they were in the bag sent to me, confirmed (very loosely) later by the person who packed it. The ward have told me they can't find them, so they're presumed lost, and I have to go through some sort of process with the charge nurse on Monday. Does anyone know, since I have no concrete proof these were in my bag and taken, unless they've documented it, that it's even possible i could be compensated for these, or is it just a case of bad luck?
As far as I can tell it should be covered under [this](https://www.tsh.scot.nhs.uk/Policies/Docs/SP05%20-%20Patient%20Property%20Policy%20-%20Feb%2020.pdf) **PDF warning**, can search for NHS Scotland Patient Property Policy instead of clicking link, which doesn't really help me in telling me if I've got much chance of getting my headphones and belt back.

MentalHealthUK,08/06/21 20:37:45,Bad experiences,"During the spring months of this year i was dealing super badly with hallucinations and delusions/paranoia. I was with early intervention psychosis for about 2 months until i randomly got discharged literally at my worst. My key worker called me an attention seeker, never wanted to talk about my symptoms and called me lazy because i couldn’t function i could barely even speak at times i felt like. I once expressed how scared i was to her that i was literally gonna hurt someone outside cause of how paranoid i was and her only answer was you won’t and that’s it. I’m 99.9% sure i got treated like this because of my age i was about 15 now i’m 16 and they told me they don’t deal with ppl my age and they rather not have me there. They discharged me because they told me i don’t have psychosis because i don’t speak to myself and can make eye contact (actual words) i got diagnosed with bpd after seeing a psychiatrist for 10 mins who clearly didn’t know anything about me because he said something like when your stressed you have hallucinations when i was experiencing them all the time and after that they never spoke to me again. 

Since then i’ve been with camhs who have no idea how to deal with me my camhs worker calls my symptoms anxiety and doesn’t even ask about them anymore cause she doesn’t know what to do about it. I’ve ended up in hospital a few times after paranoid episodes because camhs make me feel worse about it :/ i’m going on antipsychotics soon which is nice but i’m dealing with the flashbacks from that time and how early intervention treat me. I know at the time i should have got someone to complain i don’t feel like i can now and when i told my eip worker i was gonna complain she had a go at me and told me she did her job totally right :/ does this sound right?"

I get regular periods of intense anxiety and depression. Sometimes separately and sometimes together. This happens every few weeks and sometimes it spirals so that I can't think logically, and I get very agitated and get pretty intense suicidal urges and intrusive thoughts and memories. After I don't know what causes them except maybe getting overly tired and stressed or hormones? IDK. Sometimes it feels out of the blue. Anyway, I usually just get very low afterwards like not getting out of bed for 3-4 days, then I feel better and normal again until the next nervous breakdown.

I do call the crisis team when it gets particularly bad, but that doesn't help with preventing this from happening over and over again. Aside from battling not to off myself, it's hampered my ability to work and study, and that's especially annoying because I work hard only to undo it all.

If anyone has similar experiences, I'd be grateful if you could share what you do to cope or any tips? Is there a way of increasing your functionality during that time or making those periods less disruptive?

Because there has been no support offered specifically to treat the pressing issue (Or make it more bearable.) I've been back in contact with my GP again, to try and get myself some proper, long term help.

I can see myself getting worse before the worst completely arrives, and this time I fear will be the worst spout I've had thus far.

From what I've gathered I might not be able to receive this type of support until I am extremely unwell, which I presume may be occurring in the next couple of weeks unless something happens in the meantime, and I worry that I will end up doing something irrational or long-term damaging.

I really want to live, and I want to get better. I'm young and have loads of goals I want to achieve in my lifetime, but my BPD is kicking me back down the stairs. 

So, all in all, what would be a good course of action? (I understand that's a bit of a weighted question) If anyone has been in a similar boat to me, what did you do? How do I even phrase this towards a medical professional?

Thanks to any and all responses that may come my way, just trying to get by!"

MentalHealthUK,08/05/21 06:30:50,How Do I Look For Online Therapy?,"22-year-old living in Nothern Ireland here.  
I don't think I have any specific issues but I have been dealing with some general stress with where I am in life, a drop in drive and a general drag down in mood with how I'm seeing the current state of the world of at the moment.

Even if I'd hesitate to label myself with a specific issue, because I dislike making definitive statements when I'm unsure, I'm well aware with how plenty of people just dealing with daily stress benefit from seeing a therapist now and again, and have decided it might be good to seek out that sort of professional mind to hear me out and help me reorient.

Specifically, I'd prefer online therapy, so I still have some sort of live, vocal, face-to-face element without having to travel a ways out from my no-name, surrounded by miles of fields, old time.

Thing is. It's all incredibly daunting. I scan these sites seeing specializations like CBT, MBCT and psychodynamic, among others, that I know absolutely nothing about. Not to mention, I have no idea which websites As I hinted at above, I don't like committing to a decision unless I properly understand what I'm deciding to between; it makes me nervous, stresses me out, makes me doubt and second-guess unless I feel fully informed.

So, I figured there must be a subreddit like this one (yes there is, look, I found it, I'm here.\] Figured there'd be some lovely people on here who could help me out.

&amp;#x200B;

With the context out of the way: Where do I start? What's some good advice, tips, things I'd probably want to know about finding a good site and deciding which therapist might be best for me?

PS: I don't know how much this would affect responses, but reckon it's better safe than sorry to include: I have dyspraxia, hypertonia, ADHD and high-functioning autism."
MentalHealthUK,08/04/21 21:35:37,It's me again! (emergency appt in 3 weeks lady)," Feeling utterly, utterly awful. Bad tummy for 12 days now. No rhyme nor reason. Lateral flow tests normal etc. Daren't go far from a loo.

Was very ill about ten years ago when I discovered (Just in time) that I was having a reaction to lanzoperole and lost two stone in weight. Have been diagnosed with IBS in the past and I know certain food is bad for me but it just doesn't feel like that.

Paranoia, paranoia, paranoia

I can't explain why but these bouts bring on my depression BAD and very quick.  The dr has given me valium for these feelings before and they do help but I can't just keep taking them whenever I crash from a toilet bout.

What is wrong with me?

I think I was born broken."

Do you have the experience of hearing a voice or voices (sometimes referred to as auditory verbal hallucinations)?

The University of the Sunshine Coast is seeking people who are 18+ and have a menstrual cycle to participate in research looking to better understand how voice hearing experiences change over the different phases of the menstrual cycle. Participants will be asked to download a mobile phone application and fill out three surveys about their voices over the course of one menstrual cycle. Participants will receive a reimbursement to cover costs incurred such as mobile data usage. Whilst this study may not directly benefit you as an individual, it is thought that this research will improve the future understanding and management of voices.

MentalHealthUK,08/04/21 05:21:41,Brain at the end of its tether with stress (ptsd/grief and depression),"Worn out in mental anguish. Thing is no matter who or what i do it either gets worse or doesn't leave. 1 year looms on the 15th that my stepdad died a year ago. Where the fuck has the time gone i don't know.

I'm on a FOUR year waiting list for EMDR which might do fuck all. Too poor for private.

I go to a weekly woman's cree for mental health. I have done this almost every week since January. I force myself to go to the gym once or twice a week if i can handle it. I don't enjoy it and don't know why I bother.

I am on medication for depression which also helps with ptsd symptoms. I remain jumpy as ever and every little thing is a war in itself.

I forced myself to get involved with a charity that helps people over 25 that are not working. I avoiding texting them a full day as anxiety and fear takes hold. I resorted to my local community centre welfare lady to ring them up for me to get the ball rolling. Had a call that and they do face to face in September. 

Mum is stressed out and worn out. Stepbrother has disabilities and it's not easy. I miss life before his death. It was hard but not like this. 

I don't sleep well, am irritable, antisocial and want what I can't have. I recently turned 28 and everything is almost falling apart without it being so bad it's impossible. I have a bed, house to rent with mum so we aren't homeless. There's no debt as i avoid any kind of credit card shenanigans.

I have a boyfriend but we don't live together. He and his family keep pushing me in the sense that i don't work. I can't work in my opinion nor do i want to. I survive on about 3 to 4 hours sleep a night and just am worn out alot.

I just want my old life back."
MentalHealthUK,08/04/21 04:35:10,Failed at therapy,"I've now completed a six week course of CBT. I'm on 100mg of sertraline and I'm just as depressed and suicidal as I was before I started. 

The therapist was lovely but admitted after the fourth session that this therapy wasn't suitable. I did all the homework but never felt better. Eventually our time came to an end and the solution was to refer me to a heavier version of CBT. And I just can't be bothered. I'm going to end my life soon. Too tired to carry on.

I considered going private but don't have the money.

I do find it kinda funny that I was too pathetic for therapy.

Sorry for the rant."
MentalHealthUK,08/04/21 04:01:32,I’m in my head again,"I’m here again! I don’t want to be here, I need to find my way out. It’s really dark this time around and I’m not alone. I  need to drown these internal voices. 

My head hurts, I’m unproductive and my emotions are all over the place. I have an intense desire for human contact yet I totally avoid it. 

Usually I’d roll one to suppress my emotions but I quit months ago. So right now I hate herbs but I love the numb. I guess I’m just a big bowl of contradictions. 

I feel so much right now and I honestly don’t know how to put my thoughts and feelings into words. Or maybe I’m afraid to. This is the most I’ve said about my situation before. 

And trust me when I say everyone I know calls me to draw encouragement and strength when they’re low- not knowing I need someone to talk to as well. I am depressed."
