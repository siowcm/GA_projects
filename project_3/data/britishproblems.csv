My wife also said that out of our NCT group nearly every woman returning to work has had issues with their employer. So my question is this: in a supposedly enlightened age of equality, why is this still happening?"

britishproblems,01/07/22 04:58:34,Quality Streets - A Menace. Picture this right:," You’re an old lady. You’re in your mid-60s and you’ve aged pretty good making you look 30 at a glance and mid-40s at a guess. You’ve got 2 grandchildren that you have loved and cared for for years. They’re good kids and have visited you every two weeks since they were born. One of them, the oldest, is a boy. He has just turned 15 and is extremely intelligent, being about 40 points above the average IQ of children his age. You are very proud of him and confident he will succeed in life. The other is a 14-year-old girl. She is well mannered and loves to create clothes out of scraps of fabric from old clothes. She is your closest friend surpassing that of your now-deceased husband and sister. 

 Christmas rolls around and you decide, as you do every year, that you will give them both £149.99. Much like any tradition, this started thanks to their constant attention to price tags at shops and always pointing out how a penny was dropped to make it appear as if the price is actually lower. Along with this sum of money, a box of chocolates is used to accompany the cash in order to give you something to wrap. Walking down the sweet section of your local Asda, you spot the chocolate selection boxes. 2 large shelves stand tall, towering above the rest, flaunting the dominant colours of red and purple. “Celebrations” covers the top of one, and “Heroes” on the other. Whilst admiring the contents of the boxes, you spot a smaller shelf. On this shelf is a little blue tub with red writing. “Roses”, it reads. You laugh and throw it over your shoulder, thinking to yourself that some underpaid Asda child worker will pick it up later. You hear a metallic bang. You turn around to see the roses on top of a steel lockbox. “What could possibly be in it?” You mumble to yourself, shaking in fear and excitement as you waddle towards it in an elderly fashion. Clamping either side of the box, you pull out your concealed firearm and shoot the lock off of the box, relying on the sound of the annoying bitch over the shop’s speakers to muffle the sound. Grabbing the top of the box, you brace yourself for what may be inside. With a single inhale, you pull open the lid find a small purple container. “Perfect!” You cry out. You pull it out of its chamber and stuff it into your old lady purse. You quickly exit the building before you can be seen. Gone like a fart in the wind. Chuffed with yourself, you wrap the present and wait for Christmas Day. 

 It arrives. Santa has nothing on you this year. You hear a knock at your door. That must be them. Opening it, the children come through, flooding the room with their cheer. You sit around the tree, handing them their presents. You tell them “this year I got you something special! You’re going to love it!” They grab a side each and pull. The wrapping paper splits straight down the middle, revealing the brand. “Quality streets”. That night, they murder you in your sleep."

britishproblems,01/05/22 18:16:22,Everyone knows that one person who's entire identity and personality is football,"We all know one. Their whole life revolves around football. It's pathetic. They played it as a child and still play it now, going on 30 years old still trying to get a group together for ""5-a-side"" even though they drink and smoke heavily and can't jog for longer than 5 minutes without getting out of breath. First thing they do when they buy a house is buy a football net for the garden even though they don't have kids. When they do have kids they try and force them into it too even if they don't want to. They hang flags outside their windows and buy their teams shirt every year and actually wear it in public. If you aren't meeting at a pub or the city centre they turn up with a ball in the hopes you can go to any nearby grassy patch for a ""kick about"". The only time they organise a party is when the World Cup or Euros are on and cry actual tears when we inevitably lose. They buy the latest game console and only ever buy the latest Fifa, and rebuy it every single year despite the fact it's remained fundamentally unchanged since it's inception in 1993. Whenever they're in the pub they'll find any excuse to talk about it even if nobody cares, and have to sit in front of a TV even if it's showing a game with a team they don't support or a league they don't follow. The first thing they do when they meet a new person is ask them what team they support and go awkwardly quiet when someone says they aren't into it, because it is literally their whole personality and if they can't talk about football to you they can't talk to you about anything because they are a one-dimensional knuckle dragging idiot.

britishproblems,01/03/22 23:58:51,The dreaded IKEA food hall,"I entered the detestable warren that is IKEA at 10am this morning for a simple click and collect.

Mistake #1: Agreeing to make the trip with both my partner and her mother.

The click and collect took around 15 minutes. Bish, bash, bosh! Let’s go home!

“But we’re here now, so we might as well have a look around. I’ll get lunch.”

Mistake #2: Accepting lunch.

Now, in case you hadn’t already guessed, I don’t have a particularly good relationship with IKEA. In my eyes it’s an endless den of debauchery where all morals and dignity are left at the door. But, since I’ve always whipped around as fast as humanly possible, I’ve never eaten there before. I’ve always heard people absolutely rave about their food. The hotdogs, the meatballs, the weird jam. Maybe this could make it all worthwhile.

Mistake #3: Optimism.

As I was herded into what seemed like some kind of school lunch hall, I was immediately assailed by the ungodly cacophony of children’s screams and frustrated parents. 

We shuffled slowly between the stainless steel barriers feeling like cattle off to slaughter, slowly moving forwards but seemingly going nowhere.

The repetitive chant of “No Tommy, you’re not having a fucking salmon fillet, it’s 6 quid! Now stand still!” Is still ringing in my ears.

We eventually reached the food troughs.

The poor woman behind the counter was once probably a happy person who enjoyed life. Unfortunately, being trapped in meatball purgatory had seemingly drained every last bit of her soul. As she slapped down the balls of meat, potato and peas onto the plate any remaining optimism vanished.

Verdict:

I don’t even know what the meal was like. The sensory overload was so great I can’t remember. Being chained to the ball pit in a Wacky Warehouse would have been a more relaxing experience.

It’s now 4pm and I’ve only just got home.

I need a big drink, but I’ve got work tomorrow.

TL;DR Don’t go to the IKEA food hall if you value your sanity."

I usually give guests a generous 30 mins to drink up while I clean down the bar, but eventually I will need to collect all their glasses and clean the table which can't be done until the guests go home, and as such their delayed departure delays me and my co workers from going home, or just having a drink after work.

I was a little offended as I had put a lot of effort into making a nice meal, desert etc. 

After a few drinks, at 3am, he went upstairs and then proceeds to make 4/5 trips of these kinds and it turns out he had been sick. But he had been sick, not in the toilet like a normal person, but outside the bathroom ON THE CARPET and in our bidet (we're Italian). He also wiped the sick on MY TOWEL and used the WASHING UP SPONGE, leaving me without one, meaning the washing up couldn't be done for at least a day as we had plans the next day. I was very close to using for a shower. 

So its 5am and I'M the one cleaning HIS sick up because he just went to bed and it's not like he was drunk anymore. He also used a bathroom that I said was put of bounds (it's an en suite), used the unopened milk and put several things in the bin rather than the recycling.

We’re considered completely expendable. There’s no sick pay any more, and statutory sick pay is ether withheld for the first week of sickness or payed at such a low rate that it leaves you skirting the boundaries of poverty if you should ever become ill. 

It’s now standard to have a 2 year probation period when starting a new job meaning that any sense job security is none existent. 

But what’s really shocked me and left me feeling sick to my stomach is the callus way my employer has just sacked one of its supervisors. 

This is a man with 15 years service who got hit by a forklift leaving him hurt and needing to leave work and take sick. Not even 2 weeks later he’s been sacked. 

A week before Christmas and they’ve sacked him.

My biggest regret of the past 10 years is wasting my time working too hard for too little for companies that just didn’t deserve that level of effort. 

From general ops to team leader to duty manager, from retail to production to fabrication. I’ve been treated like an expendable commodity, told to work longer hours because the company needs me. Told to give 100% at work when it leaves me with 0% for myself. 

And it’s just not worth it, for the scant pay and the distain I’m shown from my employer, it’s just not worth it. 

Sorry for the rant but I needed to get that out of my system."

So now I went to find a driving different instructor let's call him B. So B told me that he cancelled my last test and rebook it for a new date with his details in. He said I should wait for a refund as he cancelled it and then give him the payment when we start lessons.

So I had to sent a message to A saying that he probably got a refund for my test because it was cancelled and rebooked and that I would be waiting for my money. He wrote back and said that he hasn't received anything and that the date for my test wasn't cancelled just moved... 

How can I know who is lying? I have no emails to confirm the cancellation because the emails went to A. B has sent me a screen shoot of the new test booking but it doesn't say anything about a cancellation or if it's a new booking? 

It could be either A not wanting to send my money back or B saying he cancelled it but actually only move the date and wants the money for it even though there was no need to charge me again? But why would he said I was going to get a refund?
